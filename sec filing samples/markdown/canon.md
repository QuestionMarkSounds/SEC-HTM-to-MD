 D. Risk factors 


 Canon is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of office multifunction devices (“MFDs”), plain paper copying machines, laser printers, cameras, inkjet printers, diagnostic equipment and lithography equipment. 

 Primarily because of the nature of the business and geographic areas in which Canon operates and the highly competitive nature of the industries to which it belongs, Canon is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following: 

 Risks Related to Economic Environment

 

 Economic trends in Canon’s major markets may adversely affect its operating results. 



 Canon’s business activities are deployed globally in Japan, the United States, Europe, Asia, and in other regions. Declines in consumption and restrained investment due to economic downturn in these major markets may affect Canon’s operating results. The operating results for products such as office, diagnostic equipment and industrial equipment are affected by the financial results of its corporate customers or medical institutions, and deterioration of their financial results has caused and may continue to cause customers to limit capital investments. Demand for Canon’s consumer products, such as cameras and inkjet printers, is discretionary. Rapid price declines owing to intensifying competition and declines in levels of consumer spending and corporate investment could adversely affect Canon’s operating results and financial position. 

 Canon’s operating and financing activities expose it to foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks that may adversely affect its revenues and profitability. 



 Canon derives a significant portion of its revenue from its international operations. As a result, Canon’s operating results and financial position have been and may continue to be significantly affected by changes in the value of the yen versus foreign currencies. Sales of Canon’s products denominated in foreign currencies have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the strength of the yen against foreign currencies. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies against the yen will generally be favorable to Canon’s foreign currency sales. Canon’s consolidated financial statements are presented in yen. As such, the yen value of Canon’s assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency transactions have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate. Unpredictable fluctuations may have certain effects on Canon’s consolidated financial statements. Although Canon strives to mitigate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations arising from its international business activities, Canon’s consolidated financial statements have been and may continue to be affected by currency translations from the financial statements of Canon’s foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which are denominated in various foreign currencies. Canon is also exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations, which may affect the value of Canon’s financial assets and liabilities.

   Canon may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the stock and bond markets. 



 Canon’s assets include investments in publicly traded securities. As a result, Canon’s operating results and general financial position may be affected by price fluctuations in the stock and bond markets. Volatility in financial markets and overall economic uncertainty create the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on Canon’s investments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. 

 High prices of raw materials could negatively impact Canon’s profitability. 



 Increases in prices for raw materials that Canon uses in manufacturing such as steel, non-ferrous
 metals and petrochemical products may lead to higher production costs and Canon may not be able to pass these increased production costs onto the sales prices of its products. Such increases in prices for raw materials could adversely affect Canon’s operating results.
 Risks Related to Canon’s Industries and Business Operations

 

 A substantial portion of Canon’s business activity is conducted outside Japan, exposing Canon to the risks in international markets. 



 A substantial portion of Canon’s business activity is conducted outside Japan. There are a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets, including the following: 

 



|  | • | unfavorable political, diplomatic or economic conditions; |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | sharp fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | unexpected political, legal or regulatory changes; |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | inadequate systems of intellectual property protection; |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel; and |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | less developed production infrastructure. |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 
 Any inability to manage the risks inherent in Canon’s international activities could adversely affect its business and operating results. 

 Canon has invested and will continue to invest actively in next-generation technologies. If the markets for these technologies do not develop as Canon expects, or if its competitors produce these or competing technologies in a more timely or effective manner, Canon’s operating results may be materially adversely affected. 



 Canon has made and will continue to make investments in next-generation technology research and development initiatives. Canon’s competitors may achieve research and development breakthroughs in these technologies more quickly than Canon, or may achieve advances in competing technologies that render products under development by Canon uncompetitive. For several years, Canon has continued its investments in development and manufacturing in order to keep pace with technological evolution. If Canon’s business strategies diverge from market demands, Canon may not recover some or all of its investments, or may lose business opportunities, or both, which may have a material adverse effect on Canon’s operating results. 

 In addition, Canon has sought to develop production technology and equipment to accelerate the automation of its manufacturing processes and in-house
 production of key devices. If Canon cannot effectively implement these techniques, it may fail to realize cost advantages or product differentiation, which may adversely affect Canon’s operating results. While differentiation in technology and product development is an important part of Canon’s strategy, Canon must also accurately assess the demand for and commercial acceptance of new technologies and products that it develops. If Canon pursues technologies or develops products that are not well received by the market, its operating results could be adversely affected.

   Entering new business areas through the development of next-generation technologies is a focal point of Canon’s corporate strategy. To the extent that Canon enters into such new business areas, Canon may not be able to establish a successful business model or may face severe competition with new competitors. If such events occur, Canon’s operating results may be adversely affected. 

 If Canon does not effectively manage transitions in its products and services, its operating results may decline. 



 Many of the business areas in which Canon competes are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance, software functionality and product features; frequent introduction of new products; short product life cycles; and continued qualitative improvements to current products at stable price levels. Canon has sought to invest substantial resources into introducing appealing, innovative and cost-competitive new products. There are several risks inherent in introduction of new products and services, such as delays in development or manufacturing, unsuitable product quality during the introductory period, variations in manufacturing costs, negative impact on sales of current products, uncertainty in predicting customer demand and difficulty in effectively managing inventory levels. Moreover, if Canon is unable to respond quickly to technological innovations with respect to information systems and networks, Canon’s revenue may be significantly affected as a result of delays associated with the incorporation into its products of such new information technologies. 

 Canon’s revenues and gross margins also may suffer adverse effects because of the timing of product or service introductions by its competitors. This risk is exacerbated when a competitor introduces a new product immediately prior to Canon’s introduction of a similar product. If any of these risks materialize, future demand for Canon’s products and services could be reduced, and its operating results could decline. 

 Changes in the print environment may affect Canon’s business. 



 In the business machines market for such products as office MFDs, copying machines and printers, customers are increasingly looking for ways to cut costs while protecting the environment. From this perspective, Managed Print Services (“MPS”), which aim to optimize printing efficiencies in the office, have become popular in recent years. This trend could lead to a decrease in business machine print volumes. 

 In addition, the digitalization of workflow in office could also lead to a decrease in customer print opportunities. If Canon is unable to supply products and services that respond to these types of market trends, its operating results may be adversely affected. 

 Canon’s digital camera business operates in a highly competitive environment. 



 As the market for digital cameras has been shrinking, competition in price and performance specifications is intensifying. Moreover, along with the significant improvements in the shooting capabilities of other digital devices, including smartphones, consumer preferences for shooting activities have changed and diversified. If Canon is unable to introduce new products that appeal to the needs of consumers and maintain its superiority over other digital device competitors, or provide new services for enjoying images, Canon could suffer from an erosion of the digital camera market, with a resulting adverse effect on operating results. 

 Canon may not be able to adequately anticipate developments related to its medical device business, including changes to the market environment and developments related to medical device approvals, certifications and health insurance coverage. 



 Regarding the market for Canon’s medical equipment sold to medical institutions, mainly in the area of diagnostic imaging, it takes a long time to design, research, develop and commercialize products, because it is necessary to prove the clinical effectiveness of new technologies and new products, and obtain regulatory approvals and certifications prior to sale in individual countries. The global market for medical devices is

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
 
    expanding due to developing medical infrastructure in emerging countries, but in developed countries issues such as aging populations, rising health insurance costs and pressure to cut medical device costs may adversely affect Canon’s medical device business. 

 Canon invests in research and development of new medical device technologies based on detailed analysis of the potential technical and business prospects for such technologies. However, despite these investments, Canon may become less competitive if it cannot anticipate whether new technologies will have the expected clinical effects or developments in the market or regulatory environment for such technologies. Canon may need to significantly modify its business plans in response to these challenges and it may not be able to generate the expected returns on its investments in research and development of medical devices. 

 Because the semiconductor lithography equipment and flat-panel-display (“FPD”) industry is highly cyclical, Canon may be adversely affected by any downturn in demand for semiconductor devices and FPD panels. 



 The semiconductor lithography equipment and FPD lithography equipment industry is characterized by fluctuating business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which are difficult to predict. Recurring periods of oversupply of semiconductor devices and panels have at times led to significantly reduced demand for capital equipment, including the semiconductor lithography equipment and FPD lithography equipment that Canon produces. Despite this cyclicality, Canon must maintain significant levels of research and development expenditures to remain competitive. A future cyclical downturn in the lithography equipment industry and related fluctuations in the demand for capital equipment could cause cash flow from sales to fall below the level necessary to offset Canon’s expenditures, including those arising from research and development, and could consequently have a material adverse effect on Canon’s operating results and financial condition. 

 Canon’s business is subject to changes in the sales environment. 



 Disruptions of relationships with large Canon distributors or acquisitions of those distributors by competitors could adversely affect Canon’s ability to meet its sales targets. In addition, the rapid proliferation of Internet-based businesses may render conventional distribution channels obsolete. These, and other changes in Canon’s sales environment, could adversely affect Canon’s operating results. 

 In addition, Canon depends on HP Inc. for a significant part of its business. As a result, Canon’s business and operating results may be affected by the policies, business and operating results of HP Inc. Any decision by HP Inc. management to limit or reduce the scope of its relationship with Canon would adversely affect Canon’s business and operating results. 

 Canon depends on specific outside suppliers for certain key components. 



 Canon relies on specific outside suppliers that meet Canon’s strict criteria for quality, efficiency and environmental friendliness for critical components and special materials used in its products. In some cases, Canon may be forced to discontinue production of some or all of its products if the specific outside suppliers that supply key components and special materials across Canon’s product lines experience unforeseen difficulties, or if such parts and special materials suffer from quality problems or are in short supply. Further, the prices of components and special materials purchased from specific outside suppliers may rise, triggered by the imbalance of supply and demand along with other factors. If such events occur as an outcome of the dependency on outside vendors, Canon’s operating results may be adversely affected. 

 Canon may be subject to antitrust-related lawsuits, investigations or proceedings, which may adversely affect its operating results or reputation. 



 A portion of Canon’s net sales consists of sales of supplies and the provision of services after the initial equipment placement. As these supplies and services have become more commoditized, the number of

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
   competitors in these markets has increased. Canon’s success in maintaining these post-placement sales will depend on its ability to compete successfully with these competitors, some of which may offer lower-priced products or services. Despite the increase in competitors, Canon currently maintains a high market share in the market for supplies. Accordingly, Canon may be subject to lawsuits, investigations or proceedings under relevant antitrust laws and regulations. Any such lawsuits, investigations or proceedings may lead to substantial costs and have an adverse effect on Canon’s operating results or reputation. 

 Cyclical patterns in sales of Canon’s products make planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable. 



 Canon generally experiences seasonal trends in the sales of its consumer-oriented products. Canon has little control over the various factors that produce these seasonal trends. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict short-term demand, placing pressure on Canon’s inventory management and logistics systems. If product supply from Canon exceeds actual demand, excess inventory will put downward pressure on selling prices and raise inefficiency in cash management, potentially reducing Canon’s revenue. Alternatively, if actual demand exceeds the supply of products, Canon’s ability to fulfill orders may be limited, which could adversely affect market share and net sales and increase the risk of unanticipated variations in its operating results. 

 Canon’s cooperation and alliances with, strategic investments in, and acquisitions of, third parties may not produce the anticipated improvements to its financial results. 



 Canon makes strategic acquisitions of other companies for the purpose of business expansion and Canon is also engaged in alliances, joint ventures, and strategic investments with other companies. These activities can help Canon to grow its business. However, weak business trends or disappointing performance by partners or acquired companies may adversely affect the success of such activities. The success of such activities may be adversely affected by the inability of Canon and its partners or acquired companies to successfully define and reach common objectives. Even if Canon and its partners or acquired companies succeed in designing a structure that allows for the definition and achievement of common objectives, synergies may not be created between the businesses of Canon and its partners or acquired companies. In addition, integration of operations may take more time than expected. In connection with its acquisitions, Canon recognizes goodwill and other intangible fixed assets on its consolidated balance sheet, and the amounts recognized may be impaired if there is a decline of future cash flow. An unexpected cancellation of a major business alliance may disrupt Canon’s overall business plans and may also result in a delayed return on, or reduced recoverability of, the investment, adversely affecting Canon’s operating results and financial position. 

 Canon depends on efficient logistics services to distribute its products worldwide. 



 Canon depends on efficient logistics services to distribute its products worldwide. Problems with Canon’s computerized logistics systems, an outbreak of war or strife within Canon’s operating regions or regional labor disputes, such as a dockworkers’ strike, could lead to a disruption of Canon’s operations and result not only in increased logistical costs, but also in the loss of sales opportunities owing to delays in delivery. Moreover, because demand for Canon’s consumer products may fluctuate throughout the year, transportation means, such as cargo vessels or air freight, and warehouse space must be appropriately managed to take such fluctuations into account. Failure to do so could result in either a loss of sales opportunities or the incurrence of unnecessary costs. 

 In addition, the increasing levels of precision required of semiconductor lithography equipment and FPD lithography equipment and the resulting increase in the value and size of such equipment in recent years have resulted in a concurrent increase in the need for sensitive handling and transportation of these products. Because of their precise nature, even a minor shock during the handling and transportation process can potentially cause irreparable damage to such products. If unforeseen accidents during the handling and transportation process render a significant portion of Canon’s high-end
 precision products unmarketable, costs will increase, and Canon may lose sales opportunities and customer confidence.

   Substantially higher crude oil prices and the supply-and-demand
 balance of transportation means could lead to increases in the cost of freight, which could adversely affect Canon’s operating results.
  Other Risks
 

 Canon’s facilities, information systems and information security systems are subject to damage as a result of disasters, outages or similar events. 



 Canon’s headquarters functions, information systems and research and development centers are located in or near Tokyo, Japan, where the possibility of damage from earthquakes is generally higher than in other parts of the world. In addition, Canon’s facilities or offices, including those for research and development, materials procurement, manufacturing, logistics, sales and services are located throughout the world and subject to the possibility of outage or similar disruption as a result of a variety of events, including natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods, as well as terrorist attacks. Although Canon continues to establish appropriate backup structures for its facilities and information systems, there can be no assurance that Canon will be able to prevent or mitigate the effect of disruptive events or developments such as the leakage of harmful substances and shutdowns of information systems. Although Canon has implemented backup plans to permit the manufacture of its products at multiple production facilities, such plans do not cover all product models. In addition, such backup arrangements may not be adequate to maintain production quantity at sufficient levels. Such factors may adversely affect Canon’s operating activities, generate expenses relating to physical or personal damage, or hurt Canon’s brand image, and its operating results may consequently be adversely affected. 

 In addition, the global spread of the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”
) has had disruptive effects on the supply chain and operations of manufacturers, particularly in Asia. As a result, Canon temporarily suspended operations in certain of Canon’s factories and has experienced reduced production in some of Canon’s factories. Although Canon expects the negative impact of COVID-19
 on global economic and market conditions will adversely affect Canon’s business, the duration and extent of the further spread of COVID-19
 remain uncertain at this time, and therefore the impact on results of operations remains unknown.
 Canon’s success depends in part on the value of its brand name, and if the value of the brand is diminished, Canon’s operating results and prospects will be adversely affected. 



 Canon’s success depends in part on maintenance and development of the value of its brand name. The main factors which could damage its brand value are defective product quality, circulation of counterfeit and failures of its compliance regime. Although Canon works to minimize risks that may arise from product quality and liability issues, such as those triggered by the individual functionality and also from the combination of hardware and software that make up Canon’s products, there can be no assurance that Canon will be able to eliminate or limit these issues and the resulting damages. If such factors adversely affect Canon’s operating activities, generate additional expenses such as those related to product recalls, service and compensation, or otherwise hurt its brand image, Canon’s operating results or reputation for quality may be adversely affected. Canon has been implementing measures to halt the spread of counterfeit products. However, the continued manufacture and sale of such products could adversely affect Canon’s brand image as well as its operating results. 

 If Canon fails to maintain its overall compliance regime, especially legal and regulatory compliance, this also could result in damage to Canon’s credibility and brand value. 

 Canon’s business is subject to environmental laws and regulations. 



 Canon is subject to certain Japanese and foreign environmental laws and regulations in areas such as mitigation of climate change, resource conservation including product recycling, reduction of hazardous substances, clean air, clean water and waste disposal. Due to the laws and regulations, Canon may face liability for additional costs and alleged damages. Such costs and damages could adversely affect Canon’s business and operating results.

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
   Canon is subject to potential liability for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at each of the properties that it owns or operates and at certain properties Canon formerly owned or operated. If Canon is held responsible for such costs in any future litigation or proceedings, such costs may not be covered by insurance and may be material. 

 Canon is subject to risks relating to legal proceedings. 



 Canon is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business. Results of actual and potential litigation are inherently uncertain. An unfavorable result in a legal proceeding could adversely affect Canon’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. 

 Canon may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims, which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling its products. 



 Because of the emphasis on product innovation in the markets for Canon’s products, many of which are subject to frequent technological innovations, patents and other intellectual property are an important competitive factor. Canon relies primarily on internally developed technology, and seeks to protect such technology through a combination of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. 

 In relation to protection of its technologies, Canon faces risks that: competitors will be able to develop similar technology independently; Canon’s pending patent applications may not be issued; the steps Canon takes to prevent misappropriation or infringement of its intellectual property may be unsuccessful; and intellectual property laws may not adequately protect Canon’s intellectual property, particularly in certain emerging markets. 

 In relation to third party intellectual property rights, if any third party is adjudicated to have a valid infringement claim against Canon, Canon could be required to: refrain from selling the relevant product in certain markets; pay monetary damages; pursue development of non-infringing
 technologies, or attempt to acquire licenses to the infringed technology and to make royalty payments, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
 Canon may need to litigate in order to enforce its intellectual property rights or in order to defend against claims of infringement, which can be expensive and time-consuming. 

 Canon also licenses its patents to third parties in exchange for payment or licensing. The terms and conditions of such licensing or changes in the renewal conditions of such licenses could affect Canon’s business. 

 With respect to employee inventions, Canon maintains company rules and an evaluation system and has been making adequate payments to employees for the invention rights based on these rules. However, there can be no assurance that disputes will not arise with respect to the amount of these payments to employees. 

 Canon’s businesses, brand image and operating results could be adversely affected by any of these developments. 

 Canon must attract and retain highly qualified professionals. 



 Canon’s future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of its employees. In addition, Canon’s future operating results depend in part on its ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel in development, production, sales and management. The competition for human resources in the high-tech industries in which Canon operates has intensified in recent years. Moreover, owing to the accelerating pace of technological change, the importance of training new personnel in a timely manner to meet product research and development requirements will increase. Failure by Canon to recruit and train qualified personnel or the loss of key employees could delay development or slow production and could increase the risks of outflow of technologies and know-how.
 These factors may adversely affect Canon’s business and operating results.

  Maintaining a high level of expertise in Canon’s manufacturing technology is critical to Canon’s business. However, it is difficult to secure the requisite expertise for specialized skill areas, such as lens processing, in a short time period. While Canon engages in advance planning to obtain the expertise needed for each skill area, Canon cannot guarantee that such expertise will be acquired in a timely manner and retained, and failure to do so may adversely affect Canon’s business and operating results. 

 Canon is subject to risks arising from dependency on electronic data. 



 Canon possesses confidential electronic data relating to manufacturing, research and development, procurement, and production, as well as sensitive information obtained from its customers relating to the customers and to other individuals and parties. This electronic data is used by Canon and third party managed systems and networks. Electronic data is also used for the information service functions in various products. 

 There are some risks inherent in the use of the electronic data, including vulnerability to hacking, computer viruses, and cyber attacks, service failures and leakage of personal information due to infrastructure issues and issues arising from damage caused by natural disasters. Although Canon continues to make administrative and managerial improvements in order to alleviate these risks, such events may occur despite Canon’s best efforts. 

 The materialization of such risks could result in interruptions to essential work, leaks of confidential data and damage to the information service functions in products. The occurrence of any of these events has the potential to cause Canon to be subject to claims from affected individuals and parties and to negatively influence Canon’s brand image, the social trust it has developed, and its operations and financial conditions. 


 Canon’s financial results may be adversely affected if its deferred tax assets are not recoverable or if it is subject to international double taxation. 



 Canon currently has deferred tax assets, which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments based on projected future taxable income. The changes of future profitability due to future market conditions and tax reforms including changes in tax rates may require possible recognition of significant valuation allowances to reduce the net carrying value of deferred tax asset balances. When Canon determines that certain deferred tax assets may not be recoverable, the amounts which may not be realized are charged to income tax expense and will adversely affect net income. 

 In addition, recently, international corporate tax avoidance has developed into a political issue with a focus on aggressive tax planning strategies of certain multinational corporations. The OECD established the BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) project for the purpose of increasing cooperation among countries and implementing harmonization of taxation. The BEPS action plan was published in July 2013; the OECD then conducted further study based on that plan and published its final report in October 2015. Each country has been revising or amending its domestic taxation system and tax treaties based on the final report. 

 Canon believes that liability of taxation is a basic and significant responsibility as a corporate citizen and that the revision or amendment will not significantly affect Canon. It is, however, possible that there will be differences in opinion between Canon and tax authorities based on new transfer pricing documentation requirements. 

 Canon’s retirement and severance benefit obligations are subject to certain accounting assumptions. 



 Canon has significant employee retirement and severance benefit obligations that are recognized based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, assumed rate of increase in compensation level and mortality rate. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore any such differences would be expected to be linked to increases in actual costs, which may adversely affect net income.

  Competition 


 Canon encounters intense global competition in all areas of its business. Canon’s competitors range from some of the world’s major multinational corporations to smaller, highly specialized companies. Canon competes in a number of different business areas, whereas many of its competitors focus on one or more individual areas. Consequently, Canon may face significant competition from entities that apply greater financial, technological, sales and marketing or other resources than Canon to their activities in a particular market segment. 

 The principal elements of competition that Canon faces in each of its markets are technology, quality, reliability, performance, price and customer service and support. Canon believes that its ability to compete effectively depends in large part on conducting successful research and development activities that enable it to create new or improved products and release them on a timely basis and at commercially attractive prices. The competitive environments in which each product group operates are described below: 

 - Office Business Unit - 


 The markets for this segment are highly competitive. Canon’s primary competitors are Xerox Corporation/Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd.; Ricoh Company, Ltd.; Konica Minolta Inc.; HP Inc.; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; and Lexmark International, Inc. Canon believes that it is one of the leading global manufacturers of office MFDs, copying machines and laser printers. In addition to the general elements of competition described above, Canon’s ability to compete successfully in these markets also depends significantly on whether it can provide effective, broad-based “business solutions” to its customers and respond to interrelated customer needs. In particular, the ability to provide equipment and software that connect effectively to networks (ranging in scope from local area networks to the Internet and the cloud) is often a key to Canon’s competitive strength. In the United States, Europe and Japan, Canon is one of the market leaders in all areas of the business machine market. In emerging markets, for example in China, the current market leaders for business machines are Fuji Xerox. Co., Ltd., Konica Minolta Inc. and Toshiba TEC Corporation. Canon plans to join this group by introducing products tailored to the Chinese market and by strengthening sales and service channels. 

 - Imaging System Business Unit - 


 Canon has continued to invest aggressively in competitive new products and intends to maintain its position in this market. 

 Canon’s primary competitors in the interchangeable-lens digital camera market are Nikon Corporation and Sony Corporation. 

 Average prices for compact digital cameras in the industry increased in 2019 from the previous year. Market contraction is having a major impact, resulting in severe conditions in the digital camera market. Despite these difficulties, Canon will seek to take advantage of its status as the major brand in the industry, along with its economies of scale, in order to maintain profitability. 

 Canon’s primary competitors in the compact digital camera market are Sony Corporation and Nikon Corporation. Canon’s primary competitors in the inkjet printer market are HP Inc., Seiko Epson Corporation and Brother Industries, Ltd. 

 - Medical System Business Unit - 


 Canon’s primary competitors in the diagnostic medical imaging market are General Electric Company, Siemens AG, Koninklijke Philips N.V., Hitachi, Ltd., and Fujifilm Corporation. Canon has also new competitors such as United Imaging Healthcare Co. Ltd., Chinese vendor.

  The markets for this segment are highly competitive. Canon has been consistently involved in the medical care business, from development to manufacturing, sales, and service. Canon believes that it provides high-resolution images that enable more accurate diagnosis. For example, we have developed several world’s-first 
 technologies, such as an ultrahigh-resolution CT scanner with twice the spatial resolution in both the in-plane 
 direction and the axial direction compared to a conventional CT scanner, and ultrasound technology that can perform imaging of very fine, slow-flowing bloodstreams that previously could not be visualized. Canon will continue to bring the latest diagnostic imaging systems to the market.
 - Industry and Others Business Unit - 


 Very stiff competition continues in the markets for lithography equipment used in the production of semiconductor devices and FPD. In order to produce lithography equipment that can provide ultra-fine processing, an integration of advanced optical, control and system technologies is required, along with continuous investment in technology development. The main competitors in these markets are Nikon Corporation, in the markets for semiconductor and FPD lithography equipment, and ASML Holding N.V., in the market for semiconductor lithography equipment only. 

 Canon believes that it has helped its customers improve their productivity by continuously improving the cost performance of semiconductor lithography equipment using the i-line
 and KrF laser light sources. In particular, equipment using i-line
 has captured a large share of the global market, satisfying the needs by quickly providing products which correspond to the diversification of devices associated with the trend of IoT.
 Canon believes its FPD lithography equipment with a common platform offers excellent productivity and reliability that has helped it capture market share of the industry-leading South Korean market. Canon’s sales and service support systems have also received high accolades from the customers in these markets. In the trend of demand expansion for 4K displays and OLED panels, Canon believes it has also been meeting the needs of panel makers by continuously offering new products with high productivity and high resolution. 

 As for network cameras, the market is competitive in higher functional requirement and price pressure from customers. Canon’s primary competitors are Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Ltd. and Panasonic Corporation. Canon is developing the innovative technology to continue to be a global market leader in this industry. 

 Environmental regulations 


 Canon is subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations, industry standards and global initiative relating to energy and resource conservation, recycling, global warming, pollution prevention, pollution remediation and environmental health and safety. Some of the environmental laws, regulations, industry standards and global initiative that affect Canon’s businesses are summarized below. 

 



| 1. | UN Frameworks to Address Global Issues, which are related to the Environment including Climate Changes |
| --- | --- |

  
  
 
 
 The United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) on September 25, 2015, under the UN Sustainable Development Summit. SDGs cover global issues to be addressed for transforming the world toward sustainable development over the next 11 years, which are composed of 17 goals and 169 targets. The goals and targets cover a wide-range global issues, including the environmental areas such as climate change, sustainable energy, efficient use of natural resources and reduction of waste. Based upon the SDGs, member states will introduce national policies and initiatives to tackle such global environmental issues, and Canon may need to implement further actions to respond to potential national initiatives. 

 The Paris Agreement on climate change was adopted in 2015 and entered into force in 2016. The Agreement relates to a common future framework beyond 2020 to address climate change. In the Agreement, all

   member states of UNFCCC agreed to take countermeasures to hold Global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial
 levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
 Upon the Agreement, Canon is further striving to reduce CO2 emissions toward the low-carbon
 society. Canon has established 2019-2021 Mid-Term
 Environmental Goals and monitors its progress to be reported to its Management for review on a yearly basis. Canon is implementing initiatives to achieve these goals, which focus on “Lifecycle CO2 emissions improvement index per product by average 3% improvement”, “Raw materials and usage CO2 emissions improvement index per product by average 3% improvement”, and “Improve energy consumption basic unit at operational sites by 1.2% (compared to the previous year)”. Canon has successfully reduced its “Life Cycle CO2 emission” per product, that was an average improvement of 5.0% (2008-2018) and cumulative 37.7% as compared with 2008. Also, total lifecycle CO2 emissions in 2018 were 7,043 million tons. Further, Canon continues to reduce its “Life Cycle CO2 emission” per product, that was an average improvement of 4.7% (2008-2019) and cumulative 40.0% as compared with 2008. Total lifecycle CO2 emissions in 2019 were 6,088 million tons, which were verified by a third party in March 2020.
 Canon continues to pursue CO2 emission reductions both locally and globally through energy-efficient product design and improvement of logistics and factory operations. 

 As for the environmental information disclosure, Canon considers the disclosure items recommended by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in the Canon Sustainability Report. Further, Canon discloses climate-related information through a platform of the CDP. 

 



| 2. | European Union Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“the RoHS Directive”) |
| --- | --- |

  
  
 
 
 Under RoHS Directive, from July 1, 2006, companies have been required to ensure that electrical and electronic equipment (“EEE”) sold in the European Union does not contain lead, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, mercury, polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated diphenyl ethers. The scope of products covered was expanded to include medical and measurement equipment starting in July 2014. New subsidiary directive of RoHS Directive restricting an additional four substances, Bis (2-ethylhexyl)
 phthalate (“DEHP”), Butyl benzyl phthalate (“BBP”), Dibutyl phthalate (“DBP”) and Diisobutyl phthalate (“DIBP”), was published in June 2015, and these substances have been restricted starting in July, 2019. In 2018, study for more additional restricted substances was started, and the preparatory study for the next recast of RoHS was started in 2019. In parallel with these developments, all the RoHS exempted applications for which the restricted substances can be used are now under review. If these exemptions expire and/or additional substances are restricted in the future, additional design changes may be required for Canon products, and cost of changing designs may increase total compliance costs.
 



| 3. | European Framework for the Management of Chemical Substances (“REACH Regulation”) |
| --- | --- |

  
  
 
 
 The REACH Regulation was implemented in 2007. This regulation covers almost all chemicals (products in gaseous, liquid, paste or powder form) and articles (products in solid state) manufactured in or imported into the European Union. All chemicals manufactured in or imported into the European Union that exceed specific content thresholds must be registered. If certain substances of very high concern are contained in an article, the substances must be communicated to the recipient or consumer of the article. In addition, such information will have to be registered on the new EU database under Waste Framework Directive from January 2021. Canon is now preparing a scheme which make necessary information input to the database. Furthermore, additional restrictions on the use of certain substances can be proposed at any time by the ECHA (European Chemical Agency) or member states, and, some of them have been already adopted and others are now under discussion, manufacturers such as Canon must take steps to address such new restrictions.

  Canon keeps meeting these existing and newly-added requirements under the REACH Regulation, and their implementation could increase Canon’s management costs and have adverse effects on its operating results and financial condition. 

 



| 4. | The European Framework for the Setting of Requirements for Energy-Related Products (“ErP Directive”) |
| --- | --- |

  
  
 
 
 The ErP Directive applies in Europe to all energy-using products, and implementing measures with respect to off-mode
 and standby mode and external power supplies were adopted in and have been applied since 2010. This measure was expanded in 2013 to include requirements for energy modes with “networked standby”. The requirements for “networked standby” were applied from 2015. The revised implementing regulation for external power supplies was published in Nov. 2019 and will be implemented from April 2020. For imaging equipment, the industry made a public commitment to attain certain targets on environmentally conscious designs from 2012 by an industrial voluntary agreement (“VA”) and began implementation in 2011. Currently the VA is under review, and commitments may become tighter than ever from 2020, because the European authorities and NGOs are expected to require a stricter VA including resource efficiency-related criteria. In addition, many new or revised implementing measures (expanded both in scope and requirements) are now considered, and some of them will cover Canon’s products. Canon is continuing to comply with requirement under the ErP Directive. However, the requirements are expected to be challenging, and achieving compliance will likely increase Canon’s costs, especially by required design changes.
 



| 5. | State Legislation in the United States Concerning Recycling of Waste Electric and Electronic Products |
| --- | --- |

  
  
 
 
 E-waste
 recycling laws have been enacted or proposed in more than twenty American states. Although most such laws cover only displays or television sets, printers and other products are covered by some states, such as Illinois, Michigan and Hawaii, among others. These laws require manufacturers to bear the costs of collecting and recycling electrical and electronic equipment based on sales volume or market share by brand of covered products. Canon expects that compliance with such state requirements might increase its costs, such as recycling fees and product guarantees.
 



| 6. | Chinese Administrative Measures on the Control of Pollution Caused by Electrical and Electronic Products |
| --- | --- |

  
  
 
 
 The Chinese Ministry of Information Industry revised Administrative Measures on the Control of Pollution Caused by Electrical and Electronic Products in January 2016, and regulates the same six substances covered by the EU RoHS in electrical and electronic products. The measures establish two stages of implementation. Stage 1 is in effect and covers all Canon products. To comply with Stage 1 requirements, a China-specific label must be placed on any covered product if any of the six regulated substances are contained therein, and use of the six regulated substances must be disclosed in each product manual. Stage 2 requires that the contents of six regulated substances in specific (as specified by the Chinese Government in the “Compliance catalog”) be restricted by limitations similar to the EU RoHS Directive. The “Compliance catalog” including printers, copying machines and facsimile machines was published on March 12, 2018. The Conformity Assessment System for products covered by the “Compliance catalog” was published on May 16, 2019, which entered into force on November 1, 2019. Canon is continuing to comply with requirement. 

 The requirements may increase Canon’s costs and have an adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition 

 



| 7. | Chinese Regulation for the Management of the Recycling and Disposal of Waste Electrical and Electronic Products |
| --- | --- |

  
  
 
 
 The Regulation for the Management of the Recycling and Disposal of Waste Electrical and Electronic Products was issued by the Chinese government in 2009 and implemented on January 1, 2011. Producers and importers are required to pay a fee to a government fund. The list of products falling under the waste electrical and electronic products catalogue issued on February 9, 2015 includes printers, copying machines and facsimile machines. Those payment fees are under discussion by the Chinese government.

  These requirements will likely increase Canon’s costs and could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition. 

 



| 8. | Soil Pollution Prevention Law of Japan |
| --- | --- |

  
  
 
 
 A 2010 amendment to the Soil Pollution Prevention Law of Japan tightens certain requirements to survey soil to measure certain pollution levels. If soil pollution exceeds specified limits, a prefecture governor may designate the land as a “Measure required area” if effects to human health due to soil pollution are foreseen, and the prefecture governor may order removal of pollutants. The substances designated as pollutants consist of twenty-six
 chemical groups, including lead, arsenic and trichloroethylene. If an investigation shows that soil contamination may affect human health, the prefecture governor may issue an order to the landowner to take designated remedial actions and may restrict the changes of the land character. Canon has commenced a detailed survey and measurement of soil and groundwater to check for pollution at all of Canon’s operational sites in Japan, and necessary procedures are being carrying out. Additional costs may arise if these investigations reveal that additional remedial measures are necessary. These factors could adversely affect Canon’s operating results and financial condition.
 



| 9. | Other Environmental Regulations |
| --- | --- |

  
  
 
 
 In addition to the laws described above, various environmental laws and regulations may have been promulgated or enacted by European Union member states, states of the United States, emerging markets such as China, India, Russia, Vietnam, and other countries. Compliance with any such additional regulations may increase Canon’s costs and may adversely affect Canon’s operating results and financial condition. 

 Other regulations 


 Disclosure under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 

 Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (“ITRA”) added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether, during the reporting period, it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 

 Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S.
 affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.
  During the year ended December 31, 2019, the following Canon affiliates engaged in the transactions described below that are required to be disclosed pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.

 A. Operating Results 


 The following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes to be relevant to understanding Canon’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 

 Overview 


 Canon is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of office MFDs, plain paper copying machines, laser printers, cameras, inkjet printers, medical equipment, semiconductor lithography equipment and FPD lithography equipment. Canon earns revenues primarily from the manufacture and sale of these products domestically and internationally. Canon’s basic management policy is to contribute to the prosperity and well-being of the world while endeavoring to become a truly excellent global corporate group targeting continued growth and development.

  Canon divides its businesses into four segments: the Office Business Unit, the Imaging System Business Unit, the Medical System Business and the Industry and Others Business Unit. 

 Economic environment 


 Looking back at the global economy in 2019, the U.S. economy continued to grow thanks to solid consumer spending based on the strong employment environment and changes in monetary policy, despite signs of a slowdown in manufacturing industries. The European economy was soft amid sluggish exports and concerns over the U.K. leaving the EU. As for the Chinese economy, despite holding discussions with the United States on trades and reaching an agreement in the first stage, the rate of economic growth dropped due to decreases in exports and capital investment caused by prolonged trade friction with the United States. As for other emerging markets, economic growth slowed due to sluggish external demand and weak pricing of natural resources. In Japan, while the employment situation remained strong, the economic recovery was modest due to a drop in manufacturing activity caused by sluggish external demand. On a global basis, the economic slowdown continued. 

 Market environment 


  Amid these conditions, in the markets in which Canon operates, demand for office MFDs was in line with the previous year, despite solid demand for color models, and due to lower demand for monochrome models. As for laser printers, demand decreased due to the impact of economic slowdowns in China and other countries. The market for cameras continued to shrink. Demand for inkjet printers continued to shrink in developed markets and remained sluggish in emerging markets due to economic slowdowns. On the other hand, although demand for medical equipment continued to recover in Japan, overall demand was in line with the previous year, mainly owing to currency depreciation and economic slowdowns in some emerging markets. While customers continued efforts to restrain capital investment in the industrial equipment market, demand for network cameras continued to expand. 

 
 The average value of the yen for the year was ¥109.03 against the U.S. dollar, a year-on-year
 appreciation of approximately ¥1, and ¥122.03 against the euro, a year-on-year
 appreciation of approximately ¥8.
 Summary of operations 


 In 2019, overall unit sales of office MFDs increased slightly compared with the previous year, despite a decline in monochrome models, and thanks to market exceeding growth in color models. As for laser printers, although sales for new models were strong, overall unit sales decreased compared with the previous year, due to slowdowns in sales of low-speed
 models. While Canon firmly maintained the top market share position, overall unit sales of interchangeable-lens digital cameras decreased compared with the previous year, owing to the shrinking market. Looking at inkjet printers, despite expanding sales of refillable ink tank models, overall unit sales decreased compared with the previous year. With regard to medical equipment, although domestic sales remained solid thanks to a strengthened product lineup, worldwide sales grew only slightly due to a first-quarter slowdown in overseas sales. As for industrial equipment, sales of lithography equipment and OLED panels manufacturing equipment decreased compared with the previous year due to efforts to restrain capital investment in semiconductor memory and small- and medium-size
 display panels. On the other hand, sales of network cameras increased steadily thanks to their broadening use in various areas. Under these conditions, net sales for the year decreased by 9.1% year on year to ¥3,593,299 million. In addition, the gross profit ratio dropped by 1.6 points to 44.8%. Operating expenses decreased by 3.8% year on year to ¥1,435,366 million, thanks to the pursuit of cost efficiencies in Canon as well as positive effects of currency exchange fluctuation. As a result, operating profit decreased by 49.1% to ¥174,667 million. Other income (deductions) increased by ¥1,133 million, mainly due to currency exchange gains and losses compared with the previous year, while income before income taxes decreased by 46.1% year on year to ¥195,740 million and net income attributable to Canon Inc. decreased by 50.5% to ¥125,105 million.

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  Total assets decreased by ¥131,114 million to ¥4,768,351 million at December 31, 2019, compared with the end of previous year, mainly due to a decrease of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivables. Total liabilities decreased by ¥5,119 million to ¥1,876,433 million at December 31, 2019, compared with the end of previous year, mainly due to a decrease of accounts payables and accrued income tax. Total equity decreased by ¥125,995 million to ¥2,891,918 million at December 31, 2019, compared with the end of previous year, mainly due to the dividend payout, the repurchasing of treasury stock and an increase of accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from the appreciation of the yen. 

 Key performance indicators 


 The following are the key performance indicators (“KPIs”) that Canon uses in managing its business. The changes from year to year in these KPIs are set forth in the table shown below.

 Notes: 

 



|  | 1. | Inventory turnover measured in days is determined by: Inventory divided by net sales for the previous six months, multiplied by 182.5. The increase of inventory turnover in 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of CMSC on December 19, 2016. If this factor were excluded, the inventory turnover would show 50 days. |

 Net sales and profit ratio 

 As Canon pursues the goal to become a truly excellent global company, one indicator upon which Canon’s management places strong emphasis is revenue. The following are some of the KPIs related to revenue that management considers to be important. 

 Net sales is one such KPI. Canon derives net sales primarily from the sale of products and, to a lesser extent, provision of services associated with its products. Sales vary depending on such factors as product demand, the 

 
 
  29

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  number and size of transactions within the reporting period, market acceptance for new products, and changes in sales prices. Other factors involved are market share and market environment. In addition, management considers the evaluation of net sales by segment to be important for the purpose of assessing Canon’s sales performance in various segments, taking into account recent market trends. 

 Gross profit ratio (ratio of gross profit to net sales) is another KPI for Canon. Through its reforms of product development, Canon has been striving to shorten product development lead times in order to launch new, competitively priced products at a faster pace. Furthermore, Canon has further pursued cost reductions through enhancement of efficiency in its production. Canon believes that these approaches will cause improving Canon’s gross profit ratio, and it will continue pursuing the curtailment of product development lead times and reductions of production costs. 

 Operating profit ratio (ratio of operating profit to net sales), income before income taxes ratio (ratio of income before income taxes to net sales), and R&D expense to net sales ratio are considered to be KPIs by Canon. Canon is focusing on two areas for improvement. Canon is striving to control and reduce its selling, general and administrative expenses as its first key point. Secondly, Canon’s R&D policy is designed to maintain adequate spending in core technology to sustain Canon’s leading position in its current business areas and to exploit opportunities in other markets. Canon believes such investments will create the basis for future success in its business and operations. 

 Cash flow management 

 Canon also places significant emphasis on cash flow management. The following are the KPIs relating to cash flow management that Canon’s management believes to be important. 

 Inventory turnover measured in days is a KPI because it measures the efficiency of supply chain management. Inventories have inherent risks of becoming obsolete, physically damaged or otherwise decreasing significantly in value, which may adversely affect Canon’s operating results. To mitigate these risks, management believes that it is crucial to continue reducing work-in-process
 inventories by decreasing production lead times in order to promptly recover related product expenses, while balancing risks of supply chain disruptions by optimizing finished goods inventories in order to avoid losing potential sales opportunities.
 The debt to total assets ratio is also one of the KPIs. For a manufacturing company like Canon, it generally takes considerable time to realize profit from a business due to lead times required for R&D, manufacturing and sales has to be followed for success. Therefore, management believes that it is important to have sufficient financial strength. Canon will continue to reduce its dependency on external funds for capital investments in favor of generating the necessary funds from its own operations. 

 Canon Inc. shareholders’ equity to total assets ratio is another KPI for Canon. Canon believes that its shareholders’ equity to total assets ratio measures its long-term sustainability. Canon also believes that achieving a high or rising shareholders’ equity ratio indicates that Canon has maintained a strong financial position or further improved its ability to fund debt obligations and other unexpected expenses. In the long-term, Canon’s management believes a high shareholders’ equity ratio will enable Canon to maintain a high level of stable investments for its future operations and development. As Canon puts strong emphasis on its R&D activities, management believes that it is important to maintain a stable financial base and, accordingly, a high level of its shareholders’ equity to total assets ratio. 

 Critical accounting policies and estimates 


 The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
 
   future market conditions, net sales growth rate, gross margin and discount rate. Though Canon believes that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual future results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Canon believes that the following are the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that currently affect its financial condition and results of operations. 

 Revenue recognition 

 Canon generates revenue principally through the sale of office, imaging system and medical system products, industrial equipment, supplies and related services under separate contractual arrangements. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised goods or services transfers to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Canon expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring these goods or services. 

 Revenue from sales of office products, such as office MFDs and laser printers, and imaging system products, such as digital cameras and inkjet printers, is recognized upon shipment or delivery, depending upon when the customer obtains controls of these products. 

 Revenue from sales of equipment that are sold with customer acceptance provisions related to their functionality including optical equipment such as semiconductor lithography equipment and FPD lithography equipment, and certain medical equipment such as CT systems and MRI systems, is recognized when the equipment is installed at the customer site and the agreed-upon specifications are objectively satisfied. 

 Most of Canon’s service revenue is generated from office and medical system products which is recognized over time. For the service contracts of office products, the customer typically pays a variable amount based on usage, a stated fixed fee or a stated base fee plus a variable amount which frequently include the provision of consumables as well as break fix activities. The majority portion of service revenue from the office products is recognized as billed since the invoiced amount directly correlates with the value to the customer of the underlying performance obligation to date. For the service contracts of medical system products, the customer typically pays a stated fixed fee for the stand ready maintenance service and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period. 

 The majority of service arrangements for office products are executed in combination with related products. Transaction prices for products and services need to be allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis where judgements are required. Canon estimates the standalone selling price using a range of prices that would meet the allocation objective based on all the information that is reasonably available including market conditions and other observable inputs. If transaction prices of the product or service contracts are not within the acceptable range then the revenue is subject to allocation based on the estimated standalone selling prices. Canon recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when related office products are sold. 

 The transaction prices that Canon is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer include certain forms of variable consideration, including product discounts, customer promotions and volume-based rebates mainly for imaging system products, which are sold predominantly through distributors and retailers. Canon includes estimated amounts in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Variable considerations are estimated based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale, and are subsequently adjusted in each period based on current information. In addition, Canon may provide a right of return on our products for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the transaction price, and accordingly Canon recognizes revenue based on the estimated amount to which Canon expects to be entitled after considering expected returns. 

 Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of income.

  Allowance for doubtful receivables 

 Allowance for doubtful receivables is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that Canon’s trade and financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility. These factors include the length of time receivables are past due, the credit quality of customers, macroeconomic conditions and historical experience. Also, Canon records specific reserves for individual accounts when Canon becomes aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to Canon, due for example to bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables are further adjusted. 

 Valuation of inventories 

 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the average method for domestic inventories and principally the first-in,
 first-out
 method for overseas inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make a sale. Canon routinely reviews its inventories for their salability and for indications of obsolescence to determine if inventories should be written-down to market value. Judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing such allowances in any accounting period. In estimating the net realizable value of its inventories, Canon considers the age of the inventories and the likelihood of spoilage or changes in market demand for its inventories.
 Impairment of long-lived assets 

 Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and acquired intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Determining the fair value of the asset involves the use of estimates and assumptions. 

 Property, plant and equipment 

 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated principally by the declining-balance method, except for certain assets which are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

 Lease 

 Canon provides leasing arrangement to its customers primarily for the sales of office products. Revenue from the sale of these products under sales-type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease. Interest income on sales-type leases and direct-financing leases is recognized over the life of each respective lease using the interest method. Leases not qualifying as sales-type leases or direct-financing leases are accounted for as operating leases and related revenue is recognized ratably over the lease term. When product leases are bundled with maintenance contracts, revenue is allocated based upon the estimated standalone selling prices of the lease and non-lease
 components. Lease components generally include product and financing while non-lease 
 components generally consist of maintenance contracts and supplies. Some of the contracts include options to extend or to terminate the lease. Canon takes such options into account to determine the lease term when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise these options. The majority of Canon’s lease contracts do not contain bargain purchase options for their customers.
 Business combinations 

 Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires the identification and measurement of all acquired tangible and intangible assets and 

 
 
  32

 
 
 
 
 

---

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  assumed liabilities at their respective fair values, as of the acquisition date. The determination of the fair value of net assets acquired involves significant judgment and estimates, such as future cash flow projections, appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other estimates based on available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including operating results, known and anticipated trends, as well as market and economic conditions. 

 Goodwill and other intangible assets 

  Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. All goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. If the carrying amount assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, Canon recognizes an impairment charge in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Fair value of a reporting unit is determined primarily based on the discounted cash flow analysis which involves estimates of projected future cash flows and discount rates. Estimates of projected future cash flows are primarily based on Canon’s forecast of future growth rates. Estimates of discount rates are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital, which considers primarily market and industry data as well as specific risk factors. Canon has completed its impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2019 and determined that there were no reporting units that were at risk of failing the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying amount. However, with regard to goodwill attributed to commercial printing business included in the Office Business Unit for which the impairment charge of ¥33,912 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017 and goodwill attributed to the Medical System Business Unit, fair values in excess of reported carrying values as a percentage are lower than other reporting units. As a result, a future reduction in cash flows of the related business, could trigger an impairment. The goodwill related to these reporting units as of December 31, 2019 are ¥27,205 million and ¥508,907 million, respectively. Intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of software, trademarks, patents and developed technology, license fees and customer relationships, which are amortized using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of software are from 3 years to 8 years, trademarks are 15 years, patents and developed technology are from 7 years to 17 years, license fees are 7 years, and customer relationships are from 8 years to 15 years, respectively. 

 
 Income tax uncertainties 

 Canon considers many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties. These factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax positions as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. The actual resolutions of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. 

 Valuation of deferred tax assets 

 Canon currently has significant deferred tax assets, which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments. Realization of Canon’s deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon its achievement of projected future taxable income. Canon’s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, its ability to continue to successfully execute its operating restructuring activities and other factors. Any changes in these factors may require possible recognition of significant valuation allowances to reduce the net carrying value of these deferred tax asset balances. When Canon determines that certain deferred tax assets may not be recoverable, the amounts, which may not be realized, are charged to income tax expense and will adversely affect net income. 

 Employee retirement and severance benefit plans 

 Canon has significant employee retirement and severance benefit obligations that are recognized based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and expected 

 
 
  33

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  return on plan assets. Management must consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. Other assumptions include assumed rate of increase in compensation levels, mortality rate, and withdrawal rate. Changes in assumptions inherent in the valuation are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect future pension expenses. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, the differences may affect employee retirement and severance benefit costs in the future. 

 In preparing its financial statements for 2019, Canon estimated a weighted-average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations of 0.5% for Japanese plans and 1.6% for foreign plans and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 3.0% for Japanese plans and 5.2% for foreign plans. In estimating the discount rate, Canon uses available information about rates of return on high-quality fixed-income government and corporate bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to the maturity of the pension benefits. Canon establishes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets based on management’s expectations of the long-term return of the various plan asset categories in which it invests. Management develops expectations with respect to each plan asset category based on actual historical returns and its current expectations for future returns. 

 Decreases in discount rates lead to increases in actuarial pension benefit obligations which, in turn, could lead to an increase in service cost and amortization cost through amortization of actuarial gain or loss, a decrease in interest cost, and vice versa. For 2019, a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate increases the projected benefit obligation by approximately ¥97,614 million. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, is deferred until subsequent periods. 

 Decreases in expected returns on plan assets may increase net periodic benefit cost by decreasing the expected return amounts, while differences between expected value and actual fair value of those assets could affect pension expense in the following years, and vice versa. For 2019, a change of 50 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would cause a change of approximately ¥4,995 million in net periodic benefit cost. Canon multiplies management’s expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by the value of its plan assets to arrive at the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense. Canon defers recognition of the difference between this expected return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets. The net deferral affects future pension expense. 

 Canon recognizes the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of its pension plans in its consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to an accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

 In the current business term, on a global basis, the economic slowdown continued. In such an environment, although each of Canon Group’s businesses endeavored to expand sales particularly with respect to new products, Canon’s consolidated net sales in 2019 totaled ¥3,593,299 million, a decrease of 9.1% from the previous year largely due to adverse effect of a shrinking market as well as unfavorable currency effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuation. Net sales of products and equipment totaled ¥2,835,428 million, a year-on-year 
 decrease of 11.2%, while net sales of services totaled ¥757,871 million, a year-on-year
 increase of 0.1%.
 Overseas operations are significant to Canon’s operating results and generated 75.7% of total net sales in 2019. Such sales are denominated in the applicable local currency and are subject to fluctuations in the value of the yen relative to those currencies. Despite efforts to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on operating results, including localization of manufacturing in some regions along with procuring parts and materials from overseas suppliers, Canon believes such fluctuations have had and will continue to have a significant effect on its results of operations. 

 The average value of the yen during the year was ¥109.03 against the U.S. dollar, a year-on-year 
 appreciation of approximately ¥1, and ¥122.03 against the euro, a year-on-year
 appreciation of approximately ¥8. The effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively affected net sales by approximately ¥90,729 million in 2019. This unfavorable impact consisted of approximately ¥19,828 million of unfavorable impact for the U.S. dollar denominated sales and unfavorable impact of ¥52,368 million for the euro denominated sales, and unfavorable impact of ¥18,533 million for other foreign currency denominated sales.
 Cost of sales 


 Cost of sales principally reflects the cost of raw materials, parts and labor used by Canon in the manufacture of its products. A portion of the raw materials used by Canon is imported or includes imported materials. Many of these raw materials are subject to fluctuations in world market prices accompanied by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that may affect Canon’s cost of sales. Other components of cost of sales include depreciation expenses, maintenance expenses, light and fuel expenses, and rent expenses. The ratios of cost of sales to net sales for 2019 and 2018 were 55.2% and 53.6%, respectively.

   Gross profit 


 
 
  Canon’s gross profit in 2019 decreased by 12.3% to ¥1,610,033 million from 2018. The gross profit ratio also dropped by 1.6 points to 44.8%.The decrease in the gross profit and gross profit ratio were mainly due to a decrease in sales and the negative effect of appreciation of the yen against other foreign currencies such as U.S. dollar and the euro. 

 Operating expenses 


 The major components of operating expenses are payroll, R&D, advertising expenses and other marketing expenses. Operating expenses decreased by 3.8% year on year to ¥1,435,366 million, thanks to the pursuit of cost efficiencies in Canon as well as positive effects of currency exchange fluctuation.

 Operating profit in 2019 decreased by 49.1% from 2018 to a total of ¥174,667 million. The ratio of operating profit to net sales decreased by 3.8 points to 4.9% from 2018. 

 Other income (deductions) 


 Other income (deductions) for 2019 was ¥21,073 million, an increase of ¥1,133 million from 2018 mainly due to a decrease in foreign currency exchange losses. 

 Income before income taxes 


 Income before income taxes in 2019 was ¥195,740 million, a decrease of 46.1% from 2018, and constituted 5.4% of net sales. 

 Income taxes 


 Income taxes in 2019 decreased by ¥39,927 million from 2018. The effective tax rate for 2019 was 28.7%, which was lower than the statutory tax rate in Japan. This was mainly due to the tax credit for R&D expense.

 Within the Office Business Unit, demand for office MFDs was strong for new next-generation color models that feature enhanced security functions. Sales of monochrome models, however, declined due to the impact of economic slowdowns in emerging markets. In the production printing market, sales of a new compact model offering high-speed and high-volume printing steadily increased. As a result, overall unit sales of MFDs increased slightly compared with the previous year. As for laser printers, despite strong demand for new models that offer low energy consumption, compact body designs, and high productivity, overall unit sales decreased compared with the previous year due to decreasing sales of low-speed
 models, mainly in China where the economic slowdown continued. Sales of consumables decreased, mainly due to the economic slowdown in Europe. These factors resulted in total sales for the business unit of ¥1,702,595 million, a year-on-year
 decrease of 5.8%, while income before income taxes decreased by 23.9% year on year to ¥174,297 million.
 Within the Imaging System Business Unit, sales of the new interchangeable-lens digital cameras for advanced amateur DSLRs enjoyed solid growth. Also, in the growing full-frame mirrorless camera market, Canon benefited from sales of new models launched in the second half of the previous year and the beginning of this year. However, the interchangeable-lens digital cameras market continued to shrink mainly for entry-level models and overall unit sales decreased compared with the previous year. As for inkjet printers, despite efforts to enhance the lineup in refillable ink tank models, overall unit sales decreased compared with the previous year, mainly affected by the sluggish economy in emerging markets. As a result, sales for the business unit decreased by 16.8% year on year to ¥807,414 million, while income before income taxes decreased by 62.1% year on year to ¥49,666 million. 

 Within the Medical System Business Unit, despite domestic sales increased steadily thanks to a recovery of demand and a series of newly launched products, sales in Europe remained sluggish in the first quarter. As a result, sales for the business unit increased by 0.2% year on year to ¥438,525 million, while income before income taxes decreased by 7.4% year on year to ¥27,283 million due to effects of currency exchange fluctuation. 

 In the Industry and Others Business Unit, although capital investment towards semiconductor devices relevant to IoT business remained solid, capital investment towards memory devices was restrained because of the deterioration in the market. Additionally, as for FPD lithography equipment and OLED panels manufacturing equipment, sales decreased compared with the previous year as capital investment for small- and medium-size 
 panels entered into a phase of adjustment. On the other hand, sales of network cameras increased reflecting the growth of Axis and the contribution of relevant software, driven by the market’s continued expansion based on diversifying market needs and replacement demand. Consequently, sales for the business unit decreased by

 Sales 


 In the current business term, the world economy seemingly mounted a gradual recovery on the whole, yet decelerated in the latter half largely due to adverse effects of trade friction. In such an environment, although each of Canon Group’s businesses endeavored to expand sales particularly with respect to new products, Canon’s consolidated net sales in 2018 totaled ¥3,951,937 million, a decrease of 3.1% from the previous year largely due to adverse effect of a shrinking market. The adoption of the new revenue standard required the reconsideration of the scope of performance obligations related to service contracts, which has resulted in a change in classification of revenues between the products and service revenues. As a result, net sales of products and equipment totaled ¥3,194,724 million, a year-on-year
 decrease of 9.3%, while net sales of services totaled ¥757,213 million, a year-on-year
 increase of 35.5%. For further information, please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Overseas operations are significant to Canon’s operating results and generated 78.0% of total net sales in 2018. Such sales are denominated in the applicable local currency and are subject to fluctuations in the value of the yen relative to those currencies. Despite efforts to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on operating results, including localization of manufacturing in some regions along with procuring parts and materials from overseas suppliers, Canon believes such fluctuations have had and will continue to have a significant effect on its results of operations. 

 The average value of the yen during the year was ¥110.43 against the U.S. dollar, a year-on-year 
 appreciation of approximately ¥2, and ¥130.29 against the euro, a year-on-year
 depreciation of approximately ¥4. The effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively affected net sales by approximately ¥1,024 million in 2018. This favorable impact consisted of approximately ¥17,800 million of unfavorable impact for the U.S. dollar denominated sales and favorable impact of ¥22,534 million for the euro denominated sales, and unfavorable impact of ¥3,710 million for other foreign currency denominated sales.

  Cost of sales 


 Cost of sales principally reflects the cost of raw materials, parts and labor used by Canon in the manufacture of its products. A portion of the raw materials used by Canon is imported or includes imported materials. Many of these raw materials are subject to fluctuations in world market prices accompanied by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that may affect Canon’s cost of sales. Other components of cost of sales include depreciation expenses, maintenance expenses, light and fuel expenses, and rent expenses. The ratios of cost of sales to net sales for 2018 and 2017 were 53.6% and 51.2%, respectively. 

 Gross profit 


 Canon’s gross profit in 2018 decreased by 7.8% to ¥1,835,554 million from 2017. The gross profit ratio also dropped by 2.4 points to 46.4%. This was mainly due to the fact that certain costs that were under operating expenses have been reclassified under cost of sales following the adoption of new accounting standards related to revenue recognitions as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The reclassified amount for the year ended December 31, 2018 was ¥115,700 million. Excluding the impact of this reclassification, the gross profit ratio increased by 0.6 points to 49.4%. 

 Operating expenses 


 The major components of operating expenses are payroll, R&D, advertising expenses and other marketing expenses. Operating expenses decreased by 10.6% year on year to ¥1,492,602 million, thanks to Group-wide efforts to thoroughly manage expenses as well as impairment loss on goodwill of commercial printing business during the previous year in addition to the impact of the aforementioned reclassification of figures related to the adoption of new accounting standards. 

 Operating profit 


 Operating profit in 2018 increased by 6.6% from 2017 to a total of ¥342,952 million. The ratio of operating profit to net sales increased by 0.8 points to 8.7% from 2017. 

 Other income (deductions) 


 Other income (deductions) for 2018 was ¥19,940 million, a decrease of ¥12,339 million from 2017 mainly due to gain on securities contributed to the retirement benefit trust during the previous year. 

 Income before income taxes 


 Income before income taxes in 2018 was ¥362,892 million, an increase of 2.5% from 2017, and constituted 9.2% of net sales. 

 Income taxes 


 Income taxes in 2018 decreased by ¥1,874 million from 2017. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 26.5%, which was lower than the statutory tax rate in Japan. This was mainly due to the tax credit for R&D expenses. 

 Net income attributable to Canon Inc. 


 As a result, net income attributable to Canon Inc. in 2018 increased by 4.5% to ¥252,755 million, which represents 6.4% of net sales.

| --- | --- |

  
 
 
 Within the Office Business Unit, unit sales of office MFDs increased from the previous year, thanks to expanded sales of such color models as the imageRUNNER ADVANCE Gen3 2nd Edition series, which enhances convenience through compatibility with external cloud services, and the imageRUNNER C3020 series of strategic models for emerging markets. As for laser printers, sales of hardware increased from the previous year, supported by steady sales mainly of new models that achieve low power consumption, compact body designs and high productivity. Sales of consumables remained at the same level as the previous year. These factors resulted in total sales for the business unit of ¥1,807,301 million, a year-on-year
 increase of 0.1%, while income before income taxes increased by 17.3% year on year to ¥229,187 million partly due to impairment loss on goodwill during the previous year.
 Within the Imaging System Business Unit, although unit sales of interchangeable-lens digital cameras decreased overall compared with the previous year due to shrinking market, Canon maintained the top share of the overall interchangeable-lens digital cameras market, mainly in key countries in Europe and the Americas as well as in Japan and China. In mirrorless cameras, sales were strong for such new models as the EOS R, Canon’s first mirrorless camera equipped with a full-frame sensor, and the entry-class EOS Kiss M. As for digital compact cameras, although unit sales decreased compared with the previous year amid the shrinking market,

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  sales of such high-value-added models as the PowerShot G-series
 enjoyed solid demand. For inkjet printers, unit sales of refillable ink tank models increased significantly in emerging markets. However, unit sales decreased overall compared with the previous year, mainly due to the shrinking market in developed economies. For large format inkjet printers, the imagePROGRAF TX series, which is suitable for outputting CAD drawings and poster designs, garnered high praise from the market and enjoyed solid sales. As a result, sales for the business unit decreased by 11.7% year on year to ¥970,435 million, while income before income taxes decreased by 26.7% year on year to ¥131,015 million.
 Within the Medical System Business Unit, sales increased due to such newly launched products as the Alphenix-series of next-generation diagnostic X-ray
 systems and the Vantage Orian, a high-image-quality MRI system incorporating leading-edge technology. As a result, sales for the business unit increased by 0.3% year on year to ¥437,578 million, while income before income taxes increased by 31.0% year on year to ¥29,479 million.
 In the Industry and Others Business Unit, unit sales of semiconductor lithography equipment increased from the previous year due to increasing demand for memory devices used in data centers. However, for FPD lithography equipment and OLED panel manufacturing equipment, sales decreased compared with the previous year mainly due to a temporary slowdown in investment in OLED panels. As for network cameras, Axis enjoyed solid sales amid increasing market demand. Consequently, sales for the business unit increased by 1.6% year on year to ¥842,941 million, while income before income taxes increased by 47.9% year on year to ¥57,846 million. 

 Intersegment sales of ¥106,318 million are eliminated from total sales for the four segments, and are described as “Eliminations”.

 A geographical analysis indicates that net sales in 2018 are summarized as follows. 

 In Japan, net sales decreased by 1.7% from the previous year mainly owing to the decline in sales of interchangeable-lens digital cameras and compact digital cameras. 

 In the Americas, despite solid sales of network cameras, net sales decreased by 2.8% from the previous year mainly owing to the negative effect of the yen’s appreciation and the decline in sales of interchangeable-lens digital cameras and compact digital cameras. 

 In Europe, net sales decreased by 1.3% from the previous year mainly owing to the decline in sales of interchangeable-lens digital cameras and compact digital cameras.

  In Asia and Oceania, net sales decreased by 6.5% from the previous year mainly owing to the decline in sales of interchangeable-lens digital cameras, compact digital cameras, manufacturing equipment for OLED panels which is sold by Canon Tokki, and manufacturing equipment for FPD. 

 Income before income taxes by segment 



 Please refer to the table of segment information in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 Income before income taxes for the Office Business Unit in 2018 increased by 17.3% from the previous year to ¥229,187 million, as impairment loss on goodwill incurred during the previous year. 

 Income before income taxes for the Imaging System Business Unit in 2018 decreased by 26.7% from the previous year to ¥131,015 million, owing to shrinking market for interchangeable-lens digital cameras. 

 Income before income taxes for the Medical System Business Unit in 2018 increased by 31.0% from the previous year to ¥29,479 million, mainly due to cost reduction and favorable sales of diagnostic X-ray
 systems and MRI systems.
 Income before income taxes for the Industry and Others Business Unit in 2018 increased by 47.9% from the previous year to ¥57,846 million, thanks to strong sales of semiconductor lithography equipment and network cameras. 

 Foreign operations and foreign currency transactions 


 Canon’s marketing activities are performed by subsidiaries in various regions in local currencies, while the cost of sales is generally in yen. Given Canon’s current operating structure, appreciation of the yen has a negative impact on net sales and the gross profit ratio. To reduce the financial risks from changes in foreign exchange rates, Canon utilizes derivative financial instruments, which consist principally of forward currency exchange contracts. 

 The operating profit on foreign operation sales is usually lower than that from domestic operations because foreign operations consist mainly of marketing activities. Marketing activities are generally less profitable than production activities, which are mainly conducted by the Company and its domestic subsidiaries. Please refer to the table of geographic information in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 B. Liquidity and capital resources 


 Cash and cash equivalents decreased by ¥107,831 million to ¥412,814 million in fiscal 2019 compared to the previous year. Canon’s cash and cash equivalents are primarily denominated in Japanese yen and in U.S. dollars, with the remainder denominated in other currencies. 

 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by ¥6,832 million to ¥358,461 million in fiscal 2019 compared to the previous year due to a decrease in profit, despite improving working capital mainly through inventory reduction. The major component of Canon’s cash inflow is cash received from customers, and the major components of Canon’s cash outflow are payments for parts and materials, selling, general and administrative expenses, R&D expenses and income taxes. 

 For fiscal 2019, cash inflow from cash received from customers decreased due to sales deterioration. There were no significant changes in Canon’s collection rates. Cash outflow for payments for parts and materials decreased due to a decrease of inventory compared with the inventory in fiscal 2018. Cash outflow for payments for income taxes decreased due to a decrease in taxable income in fiscal 2018 compared with taxable income in fiscal 2017.

  Net cash used in investing activities increased by ¥32,953 million to ¥228,568 million in fiscal 2019 mainly due to an increase in payment for purchases of fixed assets. 

 Canon defines “free cash flow” as cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities. For fiscal 2019, free cash flow decreased by ¥39,785 million to ¥129,893 million as compared with ¥169,678 million for fiscal 2018. 

 



|  | Note: | “Free cash flow” is non-GAAP  measure. Refer to “Non-GAAP  Financial Measures” section for the explanation and the reconciliation to the reported GAAP measure. |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 
 Canon’s management places importance on cash flow management and frequently monitors this indicator. Furthermore, Canon’s management believes that this indicator is significant in understanding Canon’s current liquidity and the alternatives of use in financing activities because it takes into consideration its operating and investing activities and believes that such indicator is beneficial to an investor’s understanding. Canon refers to this indicator together with relevant U.S. GAAP financial measures shown in its consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated balance sheets for cash availability analysis. 

 Net cash used in financing activities totaled ¥232,590 million in fiscal 2019, mainly resulting from the dividend payout of ¥171,487 million, the repurchases and reissuance of treasury stock of ¥50,012 million. The Company paid dividends in fiscal 2019 of ¥160.00 per share. 

 To the extent Canon relies on external funding for its liquidity and capital requirements, it generally has access to various funding sources, including the issuance of additional share capital, issuance of corporate bond or loans. While Canon has been able to obtain funding from its traditional financing sources and from the capital markets, and believes it will continue to be able to do so in the future, there can be no assurance that adverse economic or other conditions will not affect Canon’s liquidity or long-term funding in the future. 

  Short-term loans (including the current portion of long-term debt) increased by ¥3,507 million to ¥42,034 million at December 31, 2019 compared with ¥38,527 million at December 31, 2018. Long-term debt (excluding the current portion) decreased by ¥4,622 million to ¥357,340 million at December 31, 2019 compared with ¥361,962 million at December 31, 2018 thanks to the repayment for long-term loans. 

 
 Canon’s long-term debt mainly consists of bank borrowings and finance lease obligations. 

 In order to facilitate access to global capital markets, Canon obtains credit ratings from two rating agencies: Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”). In addition, Canon maintains a rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (“R&I”), a rating agency in Japan, for access to the Japanese capital market. 

 As of February 29, 2020, Canon’s debt ratings are: Moody’s: A3 (long-term); S&P: A+ (long-term), A-1 
 (short-term); and R&I: AA+ (long-term). Canon does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of its debt. A downgrade in Canon’s credit ratings or outlook could, however, increase the cost of its borrowings.
 Canon’s management policy in recent periods to optimize inventory levels is intended to maintain an appropriate balance among relevant imperatives, including minimizing working capital, avoiding undue exposure to the risk of inventory obsolescence, and maintaining the ability to sustain sales despite the occurrence of unexpected disasters. 

 Canon’s total inventory turnover ratios were 59, 56, and 49 days at the end of the fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The inventory turnover in 2019 increased due to sales decline.

  Increase in property, plant and equipment on an accrual basis in 2019 amounted to ¥178,088 million compared with ¥159,316 million in 2018 and ¥147,542 million in 2017. For 2020, Canon projects its increase in property, plant and equipment will be approximately ¥160,000 million. 

 Employer contributions to Canon’s worldwide defined benefit pension plans were ¥30,383 million in 2019, ¥35,044 million in 2018 and ¥50,628 million in 2017. Employer contributions to Canon’s worldwide defined contribution pension plans were ¥17,414 million in 2019, ¥19,570 million in 2018, and ¥18,979 million in 2017. In addition, employer contributions to the multiemployer pension plan of certain subsidiaries were ¥4,321 million in 2019, ¥4,452 million in 2018 and ¥4,165 million in 2017. 

 Working capital in 2019 decreased by ¥135,060 million to ¥885,467 million, compared with ¥1,020,527 million in 2018 and ¥1,123,169 million in 2017. Canon believes its working capital will be sufficient for its requirements for the foreseeable future. Canon’s capital requirements are primarily dependent on management’s business plans regarding the levels and timing of purchases of fixed assets and investments. The working capital ratio (ratio of current assets to current liabilities) for 2019 was 1.92 compared to 1.99 for 2018 and to 2.01 for 2017. 

 Return on assets (net income attributable to Canon Inc. divided by the average of total assets) was 2.6% in 2019, compared to 5.0% in 2018 and 4.7% in 2017. 

 Return on Canon Inc. shareholders’ equity (net income attributable to Canon Inc. divided by the average of total Canon Inc. shareholders’ equity) was 4.5% in 2019 compared with 8.9% in 2018 and 8.6% in 2017. 

 The debt to total assets ratios were 10.8%, 8.2% and 10.2% as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Canon had short-term loans, current operating lease liabilities, long-term debt, and noncurrent operating lease liabilities of ¥514,946 million as of December 31, 2019, ¥400,489 million as of December 31, 2018 and ¥532,566 million as of December 31, 2017. The company includes current operating lease liability and noncurrent operating lease liability as debt since 2019 due to adopting new accounting standard ASU No. 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842) Section A. Please refer to Note 1 (x) for more detailed information.
 Non-GAAP
 Financial Measures 

 We have reported our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we have discussed our results using the combination of two GAAP cash flow measures, Net cash provided by operating activities and Net cash used for investing activities, which we refer to as “Free Cash Flow” which is non-GAAP
 measure. We believe this measure is beneficial to an investor’s understanding on Canon’s current liquidity and the alternatives of use in financing activities because it takes into consideration its operating and investing activities.
 A reconciliation of this non-GAAP
 financial measure and the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is set forth on the following table.

   C. Research and development, patents and licenses 


 
 
  Canon has started its 5-year
 management plan, the Excellent Global Corporation Plan Phase V (“Phase V”) from the year 2016. In Phase V, our slogan is “Embrace the challenge of new growth through a grand strategic transformation” and there are three key strategies related to R&D:
 



|  | • | Establish a new production system to achieve a cost-of-sales  ratio of 45%; |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | Reinforce and expand new businesses while creating future businesses; and |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | Enhance R&D capabilities through open innovation. |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 
 Canon has been striving to implement the three R&D related strategies as follows: 

 



|  | • | Establish a new production system to achieve a cost-of-sales ratio of 45%: |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 
 Strengthen domestic mother factories by integrating design, procurement, production engineering and manufacturing technology operations while pursuing total cost reduction by advancing production engineering capabilities with more sophisticated robots and next-generation technologies such as the IoT, big data and artificial intelligence. 

 



|  | • | Reinforce and expand new businesses while creating future businesses: |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 
 Create and expand new businesses by accelerating the horizontal expansion of existing business with the exploration of new application possibility of Canon’s technologies into new fields. Also, invest intensively on the R&D of promising businesses areas such as commercial printing, network cameras and healthcare while actively taking advantage of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to accelerate the early expansion of these businesses. 

 



|  | • | Enhance R&D capabilities through open innovation: |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 
 Construct a more open R&D system that proactively leverages external technologies and knowledge to accelerate and improve efficiency of the R&D. Especially in our fundamental research and development, Canon is promoting joint and contract research with various partners including universities, research institutes, and startups around the world. 

 Canon is currently working on collaborative research with Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital to commercialize the products such as needle-guiding system which is consisted of ultra-miniature endoscope, image-guided navigation software and robot for needle insertion at the Healthcare Optics Research Laboratory in Boston. Also, CMSC is currently working on collaborative research on Deep Learning Reconstruction in MRI systems, together with Kumamoto University and the University of Bordeaux. Moreover, Canon started collaborative research with the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, to realize high-quality autologous iPS cells. 

 Canon has developed simulation systems covering comprehensive image processing including optical design, mechanical noise analysis, and thermal air flow analysis. With these simulation systems, Canon has succeeded in further reducing the need for prototypes, lowering costs and shortening product development lead times. 

 Canon believes that new products protected by the robust patent portfolio will not easily allow competitors to compete with them, and will give them an advantage in establishing standards in the market and industry. 

 Canon obtained the third greatest number of patents in the United States in 2019, according to the annual ranking list, released by IFI CLAIMS®
 Patent Services.

  D. Trend information 


 Under the corporate philosophy of kyosei

—living and working together for the common good—Canon’s basic management policy is to contribute to the prosperity and well-being of the world while endeavoring to become a truly excellent global corporation targeting continued growth and development.
 Based on this basic management policy, Canon launched the Excellent Global Corporation Plan in 1996 and, from Phase I through to Phase IV, has worked to strengthen its management base and improve corporate value. In 2016, under the slogan “Embracing the challenge of new growth through a grand strategic transformation,” Canon embarked on a new five-year initiative: Phase V of the Excellent Global Corporation Plan. Under this plan, Canon aims to facilitate growth through structural transformation by reinforcing existing businesses and taking steps to cultivate and strengthen new businesses. 

 The global economy in 2020, while a modest recovery is expected, uncertainty is increasing due to growing geopolitical risks and concerns of a relapse in U.S.-China trade friction. In addition,uncertainty about the effects of the global spread of COVID-19
, which has already affected the global economy, has continued to increase.
 In the businesses in which Canon is involved, overall demand of office MFDs is expected to increase slightly thanks to solid demand for color models. Demand for laser printers, however, is expected to be below that of last year as only a modest economic recovery is expected. As for interchangeable-lens digital cameras, although demand for entry-level models is expected to continue to shrink, demand for mirrorless cameras is expected to remain firm, particularly for advanced amateur models, including models with full-frame sensors. Demand for inkjet printers is expected to recover moderately, mainly in emerging markets. As for medical equipment, solid demand is expected thanks, in part, to expanding demand in emerging markets to improve medical infrastructure. With regard to semiconductor lithography equipment, capital investment is recovering because the price of memory devices has bottomed out. As for FPD lithography equipment and OLED panels manufacturing equipment, a gradual rise in capital investment in small- and medium-size
 display panels is expected, as is continued solid investment into high-resolution, large-size
 display panels. As for network cameras, continued market expansion is expected due to growing demand for security and diversification in the way network cameras are being used.
 In 2020, while securing and maintaining a high market share by investing into new competitive products in our existing businesses in a timely manner, and securing high profit margin, even amid market shrinkage, we will endeavor to accelerate the great strategic transformation by implementing the following priority measures in our new businesses to realize their early expansion in terms of both sales and profit. 

 (1) Commercial printing and industrial printing 


 Taking advantage of the trend that drives the transition from offset printing to digital printing, we will continue to expand and strengthen the business through the enhancement of our product portfolio and service structure. We will also push forward with product development targeting the areas of package printing and label printing, which are expected to grow going forward, based on our original technologies 

 (2) Network cameras 


 By bringing together all our group strengths, we will endeavor to expand and strengthen our solution business through the integrations of cameras, video management software, and video analysis software. 

 (3) Medical systems 


 In the diagnostic imaging systems segment, which is our core business field, we will endeavor to strengthen the sales capability in overseas markets, particularly in the U.S. We will also aim to expand into business fields with high growth potential, such as healthcare IT and bioscience.

  (4) Industrial equipment 


 We have an overwhelming share in the market of OLED panel manufacturing equipment for smartphones and will aim to increase its competitiveness further and apply it to the segment of large-size
 displays for televisions.
 For a discussion of the trend by business segments, see “Item 4 B. Business overview” and “Item 5 A. Operating Results”. 

 E. Off-balance
 sheet arrangements 

 As part of its ongoing business, Canon does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
 sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
 Canon provides guarantees for its employees, affiliates and other companies. The guarantees for the employees are principally made for their housing loans. The guarantees for affiliates and other companies are made for their lease obligations and bank loans to ensure that those companies operate with less financial risk. 

 Canon would have to perform under a guarantee if the borrower defaults on a payment within the contract terms. The contract terms are 1 year to 15 years in case of employees with housing loans, and 1 year to 5 years in case of affiliates and other companies with lease obligations and bank loans. The maximum amount of undiscounted payments Canon would have had to make in the event of default is ¥2,987 million at December 31, 2019. The carrying amounts of the liabilities recognized for Canon’s obligations as a guarantor under those guarantees at December 31, 2019 were not significant. 

 F. Contractual obligations 


 The following summarizes Canon’s contractual obligations at December 31, 2019.

  Contribution to defined benefit pension plans reflects the expected amount only for the next fiscal year, since contributions beyond the next fiscal year are not currently determinable due to uncertainties related to changes in actuarial assumptions, returns on plan assets and changes to plan membership. 

 Canon provides warranties of generally less than one year against defects in materials and workmanship on most of its consumer products. Estimated product warranty related costs are recorded at the time revenue is recognized and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Estimates for accrued product warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience, and are affected by ongoing product failure rates, specific product class failures outside of the baseline experience, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. As of December 31, 2019 accrued product warranty costs are included in accrued expenses and amounted to ¥15,846 million. 

 At December 31, 2019, commitments outstanding for the purchase of property, plant and equipment were approximately ¥36,241 million, and commitments outstanding for the purchase of parts and raw materials were approximately ¥112,831 million, both for use in the ordinary course of its business. Canon anticipates that funds needed to fulfill these commitments will be generated internally through operations. 

 During 2019, Canon expects to contribute ¥13,257 million to its Japanese defined benefit pension plans and ¥18,985 million to its foreign defined benefit pension plans. 

 Canon’s management believes that current financial resources, cash generated from operations and Canon’s potential capacity for additional debt and/or equity financing will be sufficient to fund current and future capital requirements.

 Canon established a standing committee, the Internal Control Committee in 2004, with the president appointed as chairman of the group. The Internal Control Committee has built a highly effective internal control system unique to Canon, which not only serves to ensure the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting, but also aims to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of its business operations, as well as compliance with related laws, regulations and internal controls. In 2015, with the aim of managing financial, compliance, and business risks from a comprehensive perspective, the Internal Control Committee was reorganized and renamed the Risk Management Committee which is tasked with performing this duty. Established under the Risk Management Committee are the following three subcommittees: the Financial Risk Management Subcommittee, which is in charge of improving systems to ensure the reliability of financial reporting, the Compliance Subcommittee, which is in charge of improving systems to ensure compliance of corporate ethics and major laws and regulations, and the Business Risk Management Subcommittee, which is in charge of improving systems to manage quality risks, information leakage risks and other significant business risks. The Risk Management Committee shall develop various measures with regard to improving the risk management system. These measures include the system for grasping any significant risks (violation of laws and regulations, inappropriate financial reporting, quality issues, work-related injuries, disasters, etc.) that the Canon Group may face in the course of business. Additionally, in accordance with any action plan that is approved by the Board of Directors, the Risk Management Committee shall evaluate the status of improvement and implementation of the risk management system and report its findings to the CEO and the Board of Directors. 

 The Disclosure Committee was established with the president appointed as chairman in 2005. This committee was formed to ensure that Canon is not only in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, but also to ensure that information disclosed to shareholders and capital markets is both correct and comprehensive. 

 Executive Officer System 


 Canon adopted an Executive Officer System effective April 1, 2008. Executive Officers are appointed and discharged by the Board of Directors and have a term of office of one year.

 Notes: 




| (1) | Items that relate to policies which determine the amount of director and audit & supervisory board member remuneration or its calculation method: |
| --- | --- |

  
  
 
 
 (i) Basic Policy of Remuneration 

 The Company, for the health and sustainable growth of the Canon Group, is working to design a director remuneration system that effectively encourages directors and audit & supervisory board members to fully demonstrate their abilities and fulfill their roles and responsibilities. Moreover, the total value of director and audit & supervisory board member remuneration is based on an appropriate standard, taking into consideration the recruiting and holding on to top-class
 people that can effectively meet the Company’s expectations.
 (ii) Details of Each Element of the Remuneration System 

 a. Representative Directors and Executive Directors 

 The remuneration of Representative Directors and Executive Directors consists of a basic remuneration, a bonus, and a stock-type compensation stock option.

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  Basic Remuneration 


 As compensation for the performance of duties, directors receive a fixed monthly remuneration. The remuneration is a predetermined amount based on the director’s position and the degree to which they contribute in this role. The total amount of director remuneration is not more than ¥1.5 billion a year, which was approved at the Company’s Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders for the 117th Business Term held on March 2018. (Note: the total amount includes remuneration for outside directors.) 

 Bonus 


 As a reward for directors’ service over their one-year
 term, directors receive a bonus for which consolidated income before income taxes is used as a financial indicator to measure the results of annual group-wide corporate activities. The total amount of the director’s bonus is determined by multiplying such consolidated income with a given predetermined coefficient that corresponds with the director’s position. It is also determined through individual assessment based on the degree to which the director has contributed in this role.
 Bonuses along with dividend and internal reserves are essentially subjects of corporate profit distribution. As such, matters including whether a payment is allowed or the total amount of bonus as calculated above, are deliberated during the general meeting of shareholders every year. 

 Stock-type Compensation Stock Option 


 The granting of stock acquisition rights for the Company’s shares is to further raise the motivation of these directors to improve performance from a medium- to long-term perspective as well as raise corporate value by sharing the benefits and risks of share price fluctuations with the Company’s shareholders. The total amount of stock acquisition rights of not more than ¥300 million a year, was approved at the Company’s Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders for the 117 Business Term held on March 29, 2018. The number of stock acquisition rights allotted to a director is calculated based on the amount determined by the director’s position, the consolidated income before income taxes in the previous year as well as the degree to which the director has contributed in this role (The amount contributed as consideration for granted stock acquisition rights), and the stock price level at the time of grant. As remuneration is linked to the achievements throughout one’s term in office, the Company has a system in place that allows the exercising of acquisition rights at the time of retirement due to the expiration of one’s term. As for the grantee, if the Company recognizes any misconduct of duty, act conflicting with the duty of due care, etc., the Company may limit the exercise of all or a portion of the stock acquisition rights. 

 Managing from a medium- to long-term perspective is important. Based on this, the Company places emphasis on providing a certain level of basic remuneration in a stable manner. In addition to this, consideration is also given to improved performance in a single year and the pursuit of shareholder interest when determining the breakdown between basic remuneration, bonus, and stock-type compensation stock options. The maximum amount of director remuneration accounted for by the bonus and stock-type compensation stock options on average by position is set around 50% and 30% of the basic remuneration, respectively. As for consolidated income before income taxes which is the financial indicators linked to the bonus, in 2019 (the 119th Business Term), although the Company’s outlook was for ¥347.5 billion at the beginning of the year, actual results were ¥195.7 billion. 

 b. Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members 

 As for the remuneration of outside directors and audit & supervisory board members which perform duties that are independent from a business execution standpoint, their remuneration is made up of a fixed monthly amount, namely a basic remuneration, as compensation for their service. As for outside directors, their basic remuneration is decided within a predetermined range that takes into consideration levels that are considered standard and

  within the specified yearly range that was approved at the Company’s general meeting of shareholders as described in Basic Remuneration above.

 Provisions Regarding Directors 


 There is no provision in the Company’s Articles of Incorporation as to a Director’s power to vote on a proposal, arrangement or contract in which the Director is materially interested, but, under the Corporation Law of Japan, the law relating to joint stock corporations (known in Japanese as kabushiki kaisha

) which came into effect on May 1, 2006, a director is required to refrain from voting on such matters at meetings of the board of directors.
 The Corporation Law of Japan provides that compensation for directors is determined at a general meeting of shareholders of a company. Within the upper limit approved at the shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors determines the amount of compensation for each director. The board of directors may, by its resolution, leave such decision to the discretion of the company’s representative director. 

 The Corporation Law of Japan provides that the incurrence by a company of a significant loan from a third party should be approved by the company’s board of directors. The Company’s Regulations of the Board of Directors incorporate this requirement. 

 There is no mandatory retirement age for the Company’s Directors under the Corporation Law of Japan or its Articles of Incorporation. 

 There is no requirement concerning the number of shares an individual must hold in order to qualify him as a director of the Company under the Corporation Law of Japan or its Articles of Incorporation.

  Holding of Shares by Foreign Investors 


 Other than the Japanese unit share system that is described in “Rights of Shareholders—Japanese Unit Share System” below, there are no limitations on the rights of non-residents
 or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on the Company’s shares imposed by the laws of Japan or the Company’s Articles of Incorporation or other constituent documents.
 Rights of Shareholders 


 Set forth below is information relating to the Company’s common stock, including brief summaries of the relevant provisions of its Articles of Incorporation and Regulations for Handling of Shares, as currently in effect, and of the Corporation Law of Japan and related legislation. 

 General 


 The Company’s authorized share capital is 3,000,000,000 shares, of which 1,333,763,464 shares were issued, including the Company’s treasury stock, as of December 31, 2019. In accordance with the Law Concerning Book-Entry Transfer of Corporate Bonds, Shares, etc. (including regulations promulgated thereunder; the “Book-Entry Law”), the Japan Securities Depository Center, Inc. (“JASDEC”) is the only institution that is designated by the relevant authorities as a clearing house which is permitted to engage in the clearing operations of shares of Japanese listed companies under the Book-Entry Law. Under the new clearing system, in order for any person to hold, sell or otherwise dispose of shares of Japanese listed companies, it must have an account at an account management institution unless such person has an account at JASDEC. “Account management institutions” are financial instruments traders (i.e., securities companies), banks, trust companies and certain other financial institutions which meet the requirements prescribed by the Book-Entry Law. 

 Under the Book-Entry Law, any transfer of shares is effected through book entry, and title to the shares passes to the transferee at the time when the transferred number of the shares is recorded at the transferee’s account at an account management institution. The holder of an account at an account management institution is presumed to be the legal owner of the shares held in such account. 

 Under the Corporation Law of Japan and the Book-Entry Law, in order to assert shareholders’ rights against the Company, a shareholder must have its name and address registered in the register of shareholders of the Company, except in limited circumstances. 

 The registered beneficial holder of deposited shares underlying the ADSs is the depositary for the ADSs. Accordingly, holders of ADSs will not be able to directly assert shareholders’ rights. 

 Distributions of Surplus 


 Under the Corporation Law of Japan, distributions of cash or other assets by joint stock corporations to their shareholders, so called “dividends,” are referred to as “distributions of Surplus” (“Surplus” is defined in “Restriction on Distributions of Surplus” below). The Company may make distributions of Surplus to the shareholders any number of times per fiscal year, subject to certain limitations described in “Restriction on Distributions of Surplus”. Under the Corporation Law of Japan, distributions of Surplus are required to be authorized by a resolution of a general meeting of shareholders. 

 Under the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, year-end
 dividends and interim dividends, if any, may be distributed to shareholders (or pledgees) appearing in the register of shareholders as of December 31 and June 30 of each year, respectively.
 Distributions of Surplus may be made in cash or in kind in proportion to the number of shares held by each shareholder. A resolution of a shareholders’ meeting must specify the kind and aggregate book value of the assets 

 
 
  77

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  to be distributed, the manner of allocation of such assets to shareholders, and the effective date of the distribution. If a distribution of Surplus is to be made in kind, the Company may, pursuant to a resolution of shareholders’ meeting, grant a right to its shareholders to require the Company to make such distribution in cash instead of in kind. If no such right is granted to shareholders, the relevant distribution of Surplus must be approved by a special resolution of a general meeting of shareholders. 

 Restriction on Distributions of Surplus 


 When the Company makes a distribution of Surplus, the Company must, until the aggregate amount of its additional paid-in
 capital and legal reserve reaches one-quarter
 of its stated capital, set aside in its additional paid-in
 capital and/or legal reserve an amount equal to one-tenth
 of the amount of Surplus so distributed.
 The amount of Surplus at any given time must be calculated in accordance with the following formula: 

 A + B + C + D – (E + F + G) 

 In the above formula, the letters from “A” to “G” are defined as follows: 

 “A”= the total amount of “other capital surplus” and “other retained earnings,” each such amount that is appearing on its non-consolidated
 balance sheet as of the end of the last fiscal year;
 “B”= (if the Company has disposed of its treasury stock after the end of the last fiscal year) the amount of the consideration for such treasury stock received by the Company less the book value thereof; 

 “C”= (if the Company has reduced its stated capital after the end of the last fiscal year) the amount of such reduction less the portion thereof that has been transferred to additional paid-in
 capital or legal reserve (if any);
 “D”= (if the Company has reduced its additional paid-in
 capital or legal reserve after the end of the last fiscal year) the amount of such reduction less the portion thereof that has been transferred to stated capital (if any);
 “E”= (if the Company has cancelled its treasury stock after the end of the last fiscal year) the book value of such treasury stock; 

 “F”= (if the Company has distributed Surplus to its shareholders after the end of the last fiscal year) the total book value of the Surplus so distributed; 

 “G”= certain other amounts set forth in the ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, including (if the Company has reduced Surplus and increased its stated capital, additional paid-in
 capital or legal reserve after the end of the last fiscal year) the amount of such reduction and (if the Company has distributed Surplus to the shareholders after the end of the last fiscal year) the amount set aside in the additional paid-in
 capital or legal reserve (if any) as required by the ordinances of the Ministry of Justice.
 The aggregate book value of Surplus distributed by the Company may not exceed a prescribed distributable amount (the “Distributable Amount”), as calculated on the effective date of such distribution. The Distributable Amount at any given time shall be equal to the amount of Surplus less the aggregate of the following: 

 (a) the book value of the Company’s treasury stock; 

 (b) the amount of consideration for the treasury stock disposed of by the Company after the end of the last fiscal year; and 

 
 
  78

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  (c) certain other amounts set forth in the ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, including (if the sum of one-half
 of goodwill and the deferred assets exceeds the total of stated capital, additional paid-in
 capital and legal reserve, each such amount that is appearing on the non-consolidated
 balance sheet as of the end of the last fiscal year) all or certain part of such exceeding amount as calculated in accordance with the ordinances of the Ministry of Justice.
 If the Company has become at its option a company with respect to which consolidated balance sheets should also be taken into consideration in the calculation of the Distributable Amount (renketsu haito kisei tekiyo kaisha

), it will be required to further deduct from the amount of Surplus the excess amount (if the amount is zero or below zero) of (x) the total amount of shareholders’ equity appearing on its non-consolidated
 balance sheet as of the end of the last fiscal year and certain other amounts set forth in the ordinances of the Ministry of Justice over (y) the total amount of shareholders’ equity and certain amounts set forth in the ordinances of the Ministry of Justice appearing on its consolidated balance sheets as of the end of the last fiscal year.
 If the Company has prepared interim financial statements as described below, and if such interim financial statements have been approved (unless exempted by the Corporation Law of Japan) by a general meeting of shareholders, the Distributable Amount must be adjusted to take into account the amount of profit or loss, and the amount of consideration for the treasury stock disposed of by the Company, during the period in respect of which such interim financial statements have been prepared. The Company may prepare non-consolidated
 interim financial statements consisting of a balance sheet as of any date subsequent to the end of the last fiscal year and an income statement for the period from the first day of the current fiscal year to the date of such balance sheet. Interim financial statements so prepared by the Company must be approved by the board of directors and audited by its independent auditors, as required by the ordinances of the Ministry of Justice.
 Stock Splits 


 The Corporation Law of Japan permits the Company, by resolution of its Board of Directors, to make stock splits, regardless of the value of net assets (as appearing in its latest non-consolidated
 balance sheet) per share. In addition, by resolution of the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company may increase the authorized shares up to the number reflecting the rate of stock splits and amend its Articles of Incorporation to this effect without the approval of a shareholders’ meeting. For example, if each share became three shares by way of a stock split, the Company may increase the authorized shares from the current 3,000,000,000 shares to 9,000,000,000 shares.
 Under the Book-Entry Law, the Company must give notice to JASDEC regarding a stock split at least two weeks prior to the relevant record date. On the effective date of the stock split, the numbers of shares recorded in all accounts held by the Company’s shareholders at account management institutions or JASDEC will be increased in accordance with the applicable ratio. 

 Japanese Unit Share System 


 The Company’s Articles of Incorporation provided that 100 shares of common stock constitute one “unit”. The Corporation Law of Japan permits the Company, by resolution of its Board of Directors, to reduce the number of shares which constitutes one unit or abolish the unit share system, and amend its Articles of Incorporation to this effect without the approval of a shareholders’ meeting. 

 Transferability of Shares Representing Less than One Unit 


 Under the new clearing system, shares constituting less than one unit are transferable. However, because shares constituting less than one unit do not comprise a trading unit, such shares may not be sold on the Japanese stock exchanges under the rules of the Japanese stock exchanges.

  Right of a Holder of Shares Representing Less than One Unit to Require the Company to Purchase Its Shares 


 A holder of shares representing less than one unit may at any time require the Company to purchase its shares through the account management institutions and JASDEC; provided, however, that the Company is not obliged to do so if the Company does not own its own shares in the number which it is requested to sell. These shares will be purchased at (a) the closing price of the shares reported by the TSE on the day when the request to purchase is made or (b) if no sale takes place on the TSE on that day, then the price at which sale of shares is effected on such stock exchange immediately thereafter. 

 Right of a Holder of Shares Representing Less than One Unit to Purchase from the Company its Shares up to a Whole Unit 


 The Articles of Incorporation of the Company provide that a holder of shares representing less than one unit may require the Company to sell its shares to such holder so that the holder can raise its fractional ownership to a whole unit; provided, however, that the Company is not obliged to do so if the Company does not own its own shares in the number which it is requested to sell. Such a request shall be made through the account management institutions and JASDEC. These shares will be sold at (a) the closing price of the shares reported by the TSE on the day when the request to sell becomes effective or (b) if no sale has taken place on the TSE on that day, then the price at which sale of shares is effected on such stock exchange immediately thereafter. 

 Voting Rights of a Holder of Shares Representing Less than One Unit 


 A holder of shares representing less than one unit cannot exercise any voting rights pertaining to those shares. In calculating the quorum for various voting purposes, the aggregate number of shares representing less than one unit will be excluded from the number of outstanding shares. A holder of shares representing one or more whole units will have one vote for each whole unit represented. 

 A holder of shares representing less than one unit does not have any rights relating to voting, such as the right to participate in a demand for the resignation of a director, the right to participate in a demand for the convocation of a general meeting of shareholders and the right to join with other shareholders to propose an agenda item to be addressed at a general meeting of shareholders. 

 However, a holder of shares constituting less than one unit has all other rights of a shareholder in respect of those shares, including the following rights: 

 



|  | • | to receive annual and interim dividends, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | to receive cash or other assets in case of consolidation or split of shares, exchange or transfer of shares or corporate merger, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | to be allotted rights to subscribe for free for new shares when such rights are granted to shareholders, and |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | to participate in any distribution of surplus assets upon liquidation. |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 
 Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders 


 The Company normally holds its ordinary general meeting of shareholders in March of each year in Ohta-ku,
 Tokyo or in a neighboring area. In addition, the Company may hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders whenever necessary by giving at least two weeks advance notice. Under the Corporation Law of Japan, notice of any shareholders’ meeting must be given to each shareholder having voting rights or, in the case of a non-resident
 shareholder, to his resident proxy or mailing address in Japan in accordance with the Company’s Regulations for Handling of Shares, at least two weeks prior to the date of the meeting.
 Voting Rights 


 A shareholder is generally entitled to one vote per one unit of shares as described in this paragraph and under “Japanese Unit Share System” above. In general, under the Corporation Law of Japan, a resolution can be 

 
 
  80

 
 
 
 
 

---

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
 
  adopted at a general meeting of shareholders by a majority of the shares having voting rights represented at the meeting. The Corporation Law of Japan and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation require a quorum for the election of directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members of not less than one-third
 of the total number of outstanding shares having voting rights. The Company’s shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of Directors. A corporate shareholder whose outstanding shares are in turn more than one-quarter 
 directly or indirectly owned by the Company does not have voting rights. Shareholders may exercise their voting rights through proxies, provided that those proxies are also shareholders who have voting rights.
 
  Pursuant to the Corporation Law of Japan and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, a quorum of not less than one-third
 of the outstanding shares with voting rights must be present at a shareholders’ meeting to approve any material corporate actions such as:
 



|  | • | a reduction of stated capital, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | amendment of the Articles of Incorporation (except amendments which the Board of Directors are authorized to make under the Corporation Law of Japan as described in “Stock Splits“ and “Japanese Unit Share System“ above), |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | the removal of an Audit & Supervisory Board Member, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | establishment of a 100% parent-subsidiary relationship by way of share exchange or share transfer, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | a dissolution, merger or consolidation, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | a corporate separation, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | the transfer of the whole or an important part of the Company’s business, |

| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | the taking over of the whole of the business of any other corporation, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | any issuance of new shares at a “specially favorable” price, stock acquisition rights (shinkabu yoyakuken  ) with “specially favorable” conditions or bonds with stock acquisition rights (shinkabu yoyakuken-tsuki shasai  ) with “specially favorable” conditions to persons other than shareholders, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | distribution of Surplus in kind with respect to which shareholders are not granted the right to require the Company to make such distribution in cash instead of in kind, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | purchase of shares by the Company from a specific shareholder other than its subsidiaries, |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | consolidation of shares, and |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | discharge of a portion of liabilities of Directors, Audit & Supervisory Board Members or independent auditors that are owed to the Company. |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 
 At least two-thirds
 of the outstanding shares having voting rights present at the meeting is required to approve these actions.
 The voting rights of holders of ADSs are exercised by the depositary based on instructions from those holders. 

 Subscription Rights 


 Holders of shares have no pre-emptive
 rights. Authorized but unissued shares may be issued at such times and upon such terms as the board of directors determines, subject to the limitations as to the issue of new shares at a “specially favorable” price mentioned in “Voting Rights” above. The board of directors may, however, determine that shareholders be given subscription rights to new shares, in which case they must be given on uniform terms to all shareholders as of a record date with not less than two weeks prior public notice. Each of the shareholders to whom such rights are given must also be given at least two weeks prior notice of the date on which such rights will expire.
 Stock Acquisition Rights 


 The Company may issue stock acquisition rights or bonds with stock acquisition rights (in relation to which the stock acquisition rights are undetachable). Except where the issue would be on “specially favorable” 

 
 
  81

 
 
 
 
 

---

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  conditions mentioned in “Voting Rights” above, the issue of stock acquisition rights or bonds with stock acquisition rights may be authorized by a resolution of the board of directors. Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, holders of stock acquisition rights may acquire a prescribed number of shares by exercising their stock acquisition rights and paying the exercise price at any time during the exercise period thereof. Upon exercise of stock acquisition rights, the Company will be obliged to either issue the relevant number of new shares or transfer the necessary number of existing shares held by it as treasury stock to the holder. The entitlements accorded to stock acquisition rights attached to bonds are substantially similar to those accorded to stock acquisition rights issued without being attached to bonds, provided that, if so determined by the board of directors at the time of its resolution authorizing the issue of the relevant bonds with stock acquisition rights, then, upon exercise of the stock acquisition rights, their exercise price will be deemed to have been paid by the holder thereof to the Company in lieu of the Company redeeming the relevant bonds. 

 Liquidation Rights 


 In the event of liquidation, the assets remaining after payment of all debts, liquidation expenses and taxes will be distributed among the shareholders in proportion to the number of shares they own. 

 Liability to Further Calls or Assessments 


 All of the Company’s currently outstanding shares, including shares represented by the ADSs, are fully paid and nonassessable. 

 Share Registrar 


 Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. (“Mizuho Trust”) is the share registrar for the Company’s shares. Mizuho Trust’s office is located at 2-1,
 Yaesu 1-chome,
 Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. Under the clearing system, Mizuho Trust maintains the Company’s register of shareholders and records transfers of record ownership upon the Company’s receipt of necessary information from JASDEC and other information in the register of shareholders, as described under “Record Date” below.
 Record Date 


 The close of business on December 31 is the record date for the Company’s year-end
 dividends, if paid. June 30 is the record date for interim dividends, if paid. A holder of shares constituting one or more whole units who is registered as a holder on the Company’s register of shareholders at the close of business as of December 31 is also entitled to exercise shareholders’ voting rights at the ordinary general meeting of shareholders with respect to the fiscal year ending on December 31. In addition, the Company may set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to other rights and for other purposes by giving at least two weeks prior public notice.
 Under the Book-Entry Law, the Company is required to give notice of each record date to JASDEC at least two weeks prior to such record date. JASDEC is required to promptly give the Company notice of the names and addresses of the Company’s shareholders, the numbers of shares held by them and other relevant information as of such record date. 

 The shares generally trade ex-dividend
 or ex-rights
 in the Japanese stock exchanges on the second business day before a record date (or if the record date is not a business day, the third business day prior thereto), for the purpose of dividends or rights offerings.
 Repurchase by the Company of Shares 


 Under the Corporation Law of Japan, the Company may acquire its shares (i) by soliciting all shareholders to offer to sell its shares held by them (in this case, the certain terms of such acquisition, such as the total number 

 
 
  82

 
 
 
 
 

---

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  of the shares to be purchased and the total amount of the consideration, shall be set by an ordinary resolution of a general meeting of shareholders in advance, and acquisition shall be effected pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors), (ii) from a specific shareholder other than any of the Company’s subsidiaries (pursuant to a special resolution of a general meeting of shareholders), (iii) from any of the Company’s subsidiaries (pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors), or (iv) by way of purchase on any Japanese stock exchange on which the Company’s shares are listed by way of tender offer (in either case pursuant to a resolution of the board directors). In the case of (ii) above, if the purchase price or any other consideration to be received by the relevant specific shareholder exceeds the then market price of the Company’s shares calculated in a manner set forth in the ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, any other shareholder may make a request to a representative director to be included as a seller in the proposed acquisition by the Company. 

 The total amount of the purchase price of the Company’s shares may not exceed the Distributable Amount, as described in “Restriction on Distributions of Surplus” above. 

 In addition, the Company may acquire its shares by means of repurchase of any number of shares constituting less than one unit upon the request of the holder of those shares, as described under “Japanese Unit Share System” above. 

 Right of Controlling Shareholder Representing 90 Per Cent or More of Shares to Request Other Shareholders to Sell All Shares 


 A shareholder holding, directly or indirectly, 90 per cent or more of the voting rights of the Company’s shares has the right to request, subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, that the other shareholders and (if the controlling shareholder so determines) all holders of stock acquisition rights of the Company sell to the controlling shareholder all shares and all stock acquisition rights, as the case may be, held by them. In the above case, the Company will be required to give public notice thereof to all holders and registered pledgees of shares (and stock acquisition rights, as the case may be) not later than 20 days prior to the effective date of such sales. 

 C. Material contracts 


 On March 15, 2016, Canon entered into a provisional borrowing agreement with MUFG Bank, Ltd. for acquiring CMSC. This borrowing was refinanced on January 31, 2017. For further information, please refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 All contracts other than above entered into by Company during the two years preceding the date of this annual report were entered into in the ordinary course of business. 

 D. Exchange controls 


 (a) Information with respect to Japanese exchange regulations affecting the Company’s security holders is as follows: 

 The Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Law of Japan and the cabinet orders and ministerial ordinances thereunder (the “Foreign Exchange Regulations”) govern certain aspects relating to the issuance of securities by the Company and the acquisition and holding of such securities by “non-residents
 of Japan” and by “foreign investors”, as hereinafter defined. The Foreign Exchange Regulations regarding the acquisition of listed shares and certain related matters are now being reformed, and the description below is current as of December 31, 2019.
 “Non-residents
 of Japan” are defined as individuals who are not resident in Japan and corporations whose principal offices are located outside Japan. Generally, branches and other offices of Japanese corporations
 
 
  83

 
 
 
 
 

---

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  located outside Japan are regarded as non-residents
 of Japan, while branches and other offices located within Japan of non-resident
 corporations are regarded as residents of Japan. “Foreign investors” are defined to be (i) individuals not resident in Japan, (ii) corporations which are organized under the laws of foreign countries or whose principal offices are located outside Japan, (iii) corporations of which 50% or more of the shares are held by (i) and / or (ii) above and (iv) corporations in respect of which (a) a majority of the officers are non-resident 
 individuals or (b) a majority of the officers having the power to represent the corporation are non-resident 
 individuals.
 Issuance of Securities by the Company 


 Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, the issue of securities outside Japan by the Company is, in principle, not subject to a prior notification requirement, but subject to a post reporting requirement of the Minister of Finance. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations as currently in effect, payments of principal, premium and interest in respect of securities and any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms thereof may in general be paid when made without any restrictions under the Foreign Exchange Regulations. 

 Acquisition of Shares 


 In general, the acquisition of shares of stock of a Japanese company listed on any Japanese stock exchange by a non-resident
 of Japan from a resident of Japan is not subject to a prior notification requirement, but subject to a post reporting requirement of the Minister of Finance by such resident.
 In the case where a foreign investor intends to acquire listed shares (whether from a resident or a non-resident
 of Japan, from another foreign investor or from or through a designated securities company) and as a result of such acquisition the number of shares held, directly or indirectly, by such foreign investor (if there are other foreign investors with whom the foreign investor has a special relationship as prescribed in the Foreign Exchange Regulations, the shares held by such other foreign investors will be included in the number) would become 10% or more of the total outstanding shares of the company or the number of voting rights held, directly or indirectly, by such foreign investor (if there are other foreign investors with whom the foreign investor has a special relationship, the shares held by such other foreign investors will be included in the number) would become 10% or more of the total voting rights of the company, the foreign investor must generally report such acquisition to the Minister of Finance and other Ministers having jurisdiction over the business of the subject company by the 15th day of the immediately following month in the date of acquisition falls. In certain exceptional cases, a prior notification is required in respect of such acquisition.
 Acquisition of Shares upon Exercise of Rights for Subscription of Shares 


 The acquisition by a non-resident
 of Japan of shares upon exercise of his rights for subscription of shares is exempted from the notification and reporting requirements described under “Acquisition of Shares” above.
 Dividends and Proceeds of Sales 


 Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations currently in effect, dividends paid on, and the proceeds of sale in Japan of, the shares held by non-residents
 of Japan may be converted into any foreign currency and repatriated abroad. The acquisition of shares by non-resident
 shareholders by way of stock splits is not subject to any of the aforesaid notification requirements.
 (b) Reporting of Substantial Shareholdings: 

 The Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan requires any person who has become, beneficially and solely or jointly, a holder of more than 5% of the total outstanding voting shares of capital stock of a company listed on any Japanese stock exchange to file with the relevant Local Finance Bureau of the Minister of 

 
 
  84

 
 
 
 
 

---

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  Finance within five business days a report concerning such share ownership. A similar report must also be made in respect of any subsequent change of 1% or more in any such holding or any change in material set out in a previously filed report. For this purpose, shares with exercisable rights for subscription of shares held by such holder are taken into account in determining both the size of a holding and a company’s total outstanding share capital. 

 E. Taxation 


 1. Taxation in Japan 

 Generally, a non-resident
 of Japan or non-Japanese
 corporation (a “Non-Resident
 Holder”) is subject to Japanese withholding tax on dividends paid by Japanese corporations. Stock splits are not subject to Japanese income tax. A conversion of retained earnings or legal reserve (but not additional paid-in
 capital, in general) into stated capital (whether made in connection with a stock split or otherwise) is not treated as a deemed dividend payment to shareholders for Japanese tax purposes. Thus, such a conversion does not trigger Japanese withholding taxation. (Article 2 (16) of the Japanese Corporation Tax Law and Article 8 (1) (xiii) of the Japanese Corporation Tax Law Enforcement Order).
 Pursuant to the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the “Treaty”), dividend payments made by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. resident or corporation, unless the recipient of the dividend has a “permanent establishment” in Japan and the shares or ADSs with respect to which such dividends are paid are effectively connected with such “permanent establishment,” are generally subject to a withholding tax at rate of: (1) 10% for portfolio investors who are qualified U.S. residents eligible for benefits of the Treaty; and (2) 0% (i.e.

, no withholding) for pension funds which are qualified U.S. residents eligible for benefits of the Treaty, provided that the dividends are not derived from the carrying on of a business, directly or indirectly, by such pension funds. Japan is a party to a number of income tax treaties, conventions and agreements, (collectively “Tax Treaties”), whereby the maximum withholding tax rate for dividend payments is set at, in most cases, 15% for portfolio investors who are Non-Resident
 Holders. Specific countries with which such Tax Treaties have been entered into include Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, and Singapore. Japan’s income tax treaties with Australia, Belgium, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom have been amended to generally reduce the maximum withholding tax rate to 10%. Japan’s income tax treaty with Spain has been amended to generally reduce the maximum withholding tax rate to 5%. Japan signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the “MLI”). The tax treaties with Australia, Canada, Finland, France, India, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom are partly overridden by the MLI as of January 1, 2020.
 On the other hand, unless one of the applicable Tax Treaties reducing the maximum rate of withholding tax applies, the standard tax rate applicable to dividends paid with respect to listed shares before 2037, such as those paid by the Company on shares or ADSs, to Non-Resident
 Holders is 15.315% under the Japanese Income Tax Law, except for dividends paid to any individual shareholder who holds 3% or more of the issued shares, in which case the applicable rate is 20.42% (Article 182(ii) of the Japanese Income Tax Law and Article 9-3(1)(i)
 of the Japanese Special Tax Measures Law, including its relevant temporary provision for these withholding rates).
 In order to enjoy a lower treaty rate, the taxpayer must file a treaty application in advance with the Company. Gains derived from the sale outside Japan of Japanese corporations’ shares or ADSs by Non-Resident 
 Holders, or from the sale of Japanese corporations’ shares or ADSs within Japan by a non-resident
 of Japan as an occasional transaction or by a non-Japanese
 corporation not having a permanent establishment in Japan, are generally not subject to Japanese income or corporation taxes, provided that the seller is a portfolio investor. Japanese inheritance and gift taxes at progressive rates may apply to an individual who has acquired Japanese corporations’ shares or ADSs as a distributee, legatee or donee.

   2. Taxation in the United States 

 
 
  The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Company shares or ADSs to the U.S. holders described below, but it does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular person’s decision to acquire, hold or dispose of such securities. The discussion does not address the potential application of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) known as the “Medicare contribution tax.” The discussion applies only if a U.S. holder holds the Company shares or ADSs as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes and it does not address special classes of holders, such as: 

 



|  | • | certain financial institutions; |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | insurance companies; |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | dealers and traders in securities or foreign currencies; |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | persons holding the Company shares or ADSs as part of a straddle, conversion, other integrated transaction or other similar transaction; |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | persons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar; |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes; |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | persons liable for the alternative minimum tax; |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | tax-exempt  entities; |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | persons holding the Company shares or ADSs that own or are deemed to own 10% or more of the Company stock, by vote or by value; |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | persons who acquired the Company shares or ADSs pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as compensation; or |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 



|  | • | persons holding the Company shares or ADSs in connection with trade or business conducted outside of the United States. |
| --- | --- | --- |

 
 
 This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions, final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations and the Treaty, all as of the date hereof. These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. It is also based in part on representations by the depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. An investor should consult its own tax adviser concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Company shares or ADSs in its particular circumstances. 

 As used herein, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of the Company shares or ADSs that is eligible for the benefits of the Treaty and is, for U.S. federal tax purposes:

 If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Company shares or ADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding the Company shares or ADSs and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of the Company shares or ADSs. 

 In general, if a U.S. holder owns ADSs, it will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the underlying shares represented by those ADSs. Accordingly, no gain or loss will be recognized if a U.S. holder exchanges ADSs for the underlying shares represented by those ADSs. 

 The U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom American depositary shares are released before shares are delivered to the depositary (“pre-released”),
 or intermediaries in the chain of ownership

  between the holder and the issuer of the security underlying the American depositary shares, may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by holders of American depositary shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced rate of tax applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate
 U.S. holders. Accordingly, the analysis of the creditability of Japanese taxes and the reduced rates of taxation applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate
 U.S. holders, both as described below, could be affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADSs are pre-released
 or by intermediaries.
 This discussion assumes that the Company was not a passive foreign investment company for 2019, as described below. 

 Taxation of Distributions 


 Distributions paid on the Company shares or ADSs, other than certain pro rata

 distributions of common shares, to the extent paid out of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles) will be treated as dividends for U.S. tax purposes. Because the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, it is expected that distributions will be reported to U.S. holders as dividends. The amount of a dividend will include any amounts withheld by the Company or its paying agent in respect of Japanese taxes. The amount of the dividend will be treated as foreign-source dividend income and will generally not be eligible for the dividends-received deductions allowed to U.S. corporations. Subject to applicable limitations that may vary depending upon a U.S. holder’s individual circumstances and the concerns of the U.S. Treasury described above, dividends paid to certain non-corporate
 U.S. holders will be taxable at the favorable rates applicable to long-term capital gains. Non-corporate
 U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisers to determine whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at these favorable rates.
 Dividends paid in Japanese yen will be included in a U.S. holder’s income in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt of the dividend by the U.S. holder, in the case of the Company shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADSs, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. If the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. holder generally should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income. A U.S. holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt. 

 Japanese income taxes withheld from cash dividends on the Company shares or ADSs at a rate not exceeding the rate provided by the Treaty will be creditable against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, subject to applicable limitations that may vary depending upon a U.S. holder’s circumstances and the concerns expressed by the U.S. Treasury described above. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex, and a U.S. holder should consult its own tax adviser regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in its particular circumstances. Instead of claiming a credit, a U.S. holder may, at its election, deduct such Japanese taxes in computing its income, subject to generally applicable limitations under U.S. federal income tax law. 

 Sale or Other Disposition of the Company Shares or ADSs 


 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, gain or loss a U.S. holder realizes on the sale or other disposition of the Company shares or ADSs will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such holder held the Company shares or ADSs for more than one year. The amount of a U.S. holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar amount realized on the disposition and the U.S. holder’s U.S. dollar tax basis in the Company shares or ADSs that were disposed of. Such gain or loss will generally be U.S.-source gain or loss for foreign tax credit purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation.

  Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules 


 The Company believes that it was not a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its 2019 fiscal year. However, since PFIC status depends upon the composition of the Company’s income and assets and the market value of its assets (including, among others, goodwill and equity investments in less than 25% owned entities) from time to time, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. If the Company were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder owned the Company shares or ADSs, certain adverse tax consequences could apply to such U.S. holder. 

 If the Company were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder owned the Company shares or ADSs, gain recognized by a U.S. holder on the sale or other disposition, including certain pledges, of the Company shares or ADSs would be allocated ratably over its holding period for such securities. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any year before the Company became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect in such taxable year for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, and an interest charge would be imposed on the tax liability attributable to such allocated amounts. Further, any distribution in respect of the Company shares or ADSs in excess of 125% of the average of the annual distributions on such securities received by a U.S. holder during the preceding three years or its holding period, whichever is shorter, would be subject to taxation as described immediately above. Certain elections (including a mark-to-market 
 election) may be available to a U.S. holder that would result in alternative tax treatments.
 In addition, if the Company were a PFIC or, with respect to a particular U.S. holder, were treated as a PFIC in a taxable year in which it pays a dividend or the prior taxable year, the favorable tax rates discussed above with respect to dividends paid to certain non-corporate
 U.S. holders would not apply.
 If the Company were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder owned the Company shares or ADSs, the U.S. holder would generally be required to file IRS Form 8621 with its annual U.S. federal income tax return, subject to certain exceptions. 

 Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 


 Payments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding unless the U.S. holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, the U.S. holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding. 

 Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. holder will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. 

 Certain U.S. holders who are individuals may be required to report information relating to stock of a non-U.S.
 person, generally on IRS Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for stock held in custodial accounts maintained by a U.S. financial institution). U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their tax reporting obligations.

 Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 


 Market risk exposures 


 Canon is exposed to market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and prices of marketable securities and investments. In order to hedge the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Canon uses derivative financial instruments. 

 Equity price risk 


 Canon holds marketable securities included in current assets, which consist generally of highly-liquid and low-risk
 instruments. Investments included in noncurrent assets are held as long-term investments. Canon does not hold marketable securities and investments for trading purposes.
 Maturities and fair values of such marketable securities and investments with original maturities of more than three months were as follows at December 31, 2019.

 Foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk 


 Canon operates internationally, exposing it to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Derivative financial instruments are comprised principally of foreign currency exchange contracts utilized by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to reduce the risk. Canon assesses foreign currency exchange rate risk by continually monitoring changes in the exposures and by evaluating hedging opportunities. Canon does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Canon is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance
 by counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but it is not expected that any counterparties will fail to meet their obligations. Most of the counterparties are internationally recognized financial institutions and selected by Canon taking into account their financial condition, and contracts are diversified across a number of major financial institutions.
 Canon’s international operations expose Canon to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Canon uses foreign exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures principally from 

 
 
  89

 
 
 
 
 

---

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  the exchange of U.S. dollars and euros into Japanese yen. These contracts are primarily used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of forecasted intercompany sales and intercompany trade receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies. In accordance with Canon’s policy, a specific portion of foreign currency exposure resulting from forecasted intercompany sales are hedged using foreign exchange contracts which principally mature within three months. 

 The following table provides information about Canon’s major derivative financial instruments related to foreign currency exchange transactions existing at December 31, 2019. All of the foreign exchange contracts described in the following table have a contractual maturity date in 2020. 




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| Estimated fair value |  |  | (173 | ) |  |  | (16 | ) |  |  | 190 |  |  |  | 1 |  |

 
 
 Canon expects that fair value changes and cash flows resulting from reasonable near-term changes in interest rates will be immaterial. Accordingly, Canon believes interest rate risk is insignificant. See also Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges, including foreign exchange contracts associated with forecasted intercompany sales, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These amounts are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged items affect earnings. Substantially all amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2019 are expected to be recognized in net sales over the next twelve months. After the adoption of ASU No. 2017-12
 from the quarter beginning January 1, 2019, Canon includes the time value component in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, which had been previously excluded. Changes in the fair value of a foreign exchange contract for the period between the date that the forecasted intercompany sales occur and its maturity date are recognized in earnings.
 The amount of the hedging ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The amounts of net losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (time value component) which was recorded in other income (deductions) were ¥682 million and ¥332 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

 Canon has entered into certain foreign currency exchange contracts to manage its foreign currency exposures. These foreign currency exchange contracts have not been designated as hedges. Accordingly, the changes in fair values of these contracts are recorded in earnings immediately.

 Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds 


 None. 

 Item 15. Controls and Procedures 


 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 


 Canon’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and Canon’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that Canon’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
 of the Exchange Act, are effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2019.
 Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 


 The management of Canon is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

 Canon’s management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in internal Control –Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). 

 Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, Canon’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the COSO criteria. 

 Canon’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of Canon’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears in Item 18.

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 


 There has been no change in Canon’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 

 Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert 


 Canon’s Audit & Supervisory Board has determined that Hiroshi Yoshida is an “audit committee financial expert” as defined by the rules of the SEC. Hiroshi Yoshida has considerable experience and advanced expert knowledge in corporate accounting gained thorough his longstanding practice as a certified public accountant. Hiroshi Yoshida was elected as one of Canon’s Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members at an ordinary general meeting of shareholders held in March 2017. Hiroshi Yoshida meets the independence requirements imposed on Audit & Supervisory Board Members as set forth by Japanese stock exchange regulations; however, he does not meet the independence standards for Audit & Supervisory Board Members of the Company. 

 Item 16B. Code of Ethics 


 Canon maintains a “Canon Group Code of Conduct” or Code of Conduct, applicable to all executives and employees. The Code of Conduct sets forth provisions relating to honest and ethical conduct (including the handling of conflicts of interest), compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and accountability for adherence to the provisions of the Code of Conduct. The Board of Directors maintains a “Code of Ethics” as a supplement to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Ethics applies to Canon’s President and Chief Executive Officer, each member of the Board of Directors (which includes the Chief Financial Officer) and general managers belonging to Canon’s accounting headquarters. The Code of Ethics requires full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that Canon files with or submits to the SEC and in Canon’s other communications with the public, prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Conduct or Code of Ethics, and accountability for adherence to their provisions. Both the Code of Conduct and the Code of Ethics have been filed as exhibits. 

 Item 16C. Principal Accountant Fees and Services 


 Policy on Pre-Approval
 of Audit and Non-Audit
 Services of Independent Auditors 

 Canon’s Audit & Supervisory Board consisting of five members, including three outside auditors, is responsible for the oversight of the services of its independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit & Supervisory Board has established Pre-Approval
 Policies and Procedures for Audit and Non-Audit
 Services. These policies and procedures govern the Audit & Supervisory Board’s review and approval of the board of director’s engagement of Canon’s independent registered public accounting firm to render audit or non-audit 
 services. Non-audit
 services include audit-related services, tax services and other services, as described in greater detail below under “Fees and Services.” Canon and any affiliate controlled by Canon directly, indirectly or through one or more intermediaries must follow these policies and procedures before any engagement of Canon’s independent registered public accounting firm for U.S. securities law reporting purposes.
 The policies and procedures stipulate three means by which audit and non-audit
 services may be pre-approved,
 depending on the content of and the fee for the services.
 



|  | • | All services provided to Canon necessary to perform an annual audit or review to comply with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), in any jurisdiction, including tax services and accounting consultation necessary to comply with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) in those jurisdictions, and any engagement of an Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for any audit or non-audit  service involving estimated fees exceeding ¥10,000,000 per single engagement must be pre-approved  by the majority of Audit & Supervisory Board. |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 
 
 
  93

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
 


|  | • | Certain other services may be pre-approved  under detailed categories of audit and non-audit  services established annually by the Audit & Supervisory Board, as long as those services do not exceed specified maximum yen limits for aggregate fees relating to each of those categories. Any engagement of an Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm by this means must be reported to the Audit & Supervisory Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | For services that are not covered by the above two means of pre-approval,  the Audit & Supervisory Board has delegated pre-approval  authority to any of the standing Audit & Supervisory Board Members of the board. Any engagement of an Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm pre-approved  by one of the standing Audit & Supervisory Board Members is required to be reported to the Audit & Supervisory Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 
 Additional services may be pre-approved
 by the Audit & Supervisory Board on an individual basis.
 No services were provided for which pre-approval
 was waived pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01
 of Regulation S-X. 

 Fees and services 


 The following table discloses the aggregate fees accrued or paid to Canon’s principal accountant and member firms of Ernst & Young for each of the last two fiscal years and briefly describes the services performed:

 Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC served as Canon’s principal accountant for 2019 and 2018. 

 Item 16D. Exemptions from the Listing Standards for Audit Committees 


 Canon is relying on the general exemption contained in Rule 10A-3(c)(3)
 under the Exchange Act. Because of such reliance, Canon does not have an audit committee which can act independently and satisfy the other requirements of Rule 10A-3
 under the Exchange Act.
 
 
  94

 
 
 
 
 

---

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  According to Rule 10A-3
 under the Exchange Act and NYSE listing standards, Canon’s Audit & Supervisory Board has been identified to act in place of an audit committee. The Audit & Supervisory Board meets the following requirements of the general exemption contained in Rule 10A-3(c)(3): 

 



|  | • | the Audit & Supervisory Board is established pursuant to applicable Japanese law and Canon’s Articles of Incorporation; |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | under Japanese legal requirements, the Audit & Supervisory Board is separate from the board of directors; |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | the Audit & Supervisory Board is not elected by the management of Canon and no executive officer of Canon is a member of the Audit & Supervisory Board; |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | Japanese regulations provide for standards for the independence of the Audit & Supervisory Board from the Company and its management; |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | the Audit & Supervisory Board, in accordance with and to the extent permitted by Japanese law, is responsible for the appointment, retention and oversight of the work of Canon’s external auditors engaged for the purpose of issuing audit reports on Canon’s annual financial statements; |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | the Audit & Supervisory Board maintains a complaints procedure in accordance with Rule 10A-3(b)(3)   of the Exchange Act; |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | the Audit & Supervisory Board is authorized to engage independent counsel and other advisers, as it deems appropriate; and |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 



|  | • | the Audit & Supervisory Board is provided with appropriate funding for payment of (i) compensation to Canon’s independent registered public accounting firm engaged for the purpose of issuing audit reports on Canon’s annual financial statements, (ii) compensation to independent counsel and other advisers engaged by the Audit & Supervisory Board, and (iii) ordinary administrative expenses of the Audit & Supervisory Board in carrying out its duties. |
| --- | --- | --- |

  
 
 
 Canon’s reliance on Rule 10A-3(c)(3)
 does not, in its opinion, materially adversely affect the ability of its Audit & Supervisory Board to act independently and to satisfy the other requirements of Rule 10A-3. 

 Item 16E. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 


 The following table sets forth, for each of the months indicated, the total number of shares purchased by Canon, or on Canon’s behalf or by any affiliated purchaser, the average price paid per share, the number of shares purchased pursuant to the applicable shareholder resolution or board resolution, which are publicly announced, and the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to these shareholder resolutions or board resolutions.

 Item 16F. Change in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant 


 At a meeting held on January 28, 2020, the Company’s Audit and Supervisory Board approved, subject to shareholders’ approval, the dismissal of Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC as the Company’s certified public accountant or auditing firm upon the conclusion of the annual shareholders’ meeting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. At the same meeting the Company’s Audit and Supervisory Board approved the engagement of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC subject to shareholder approval. The change was approved by the Company’s shareholders at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on March 27, 2020. 

 The Company’s Audit and Supervisory Board conducted a comparative assessment of several candidate firms from 2016 from the perspective of qualifications and independence, following the introduction of an auditor rotation system in other countries. In addition, the Company’s Audit and Supervisory Board has determined to receive a proposal from several candidate firms periodically. 

 After considering Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC’s consecutive years of service to the Company and comprehensively reviewing Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC’s independence, expertise, their quality management structure and global auditing structure, the Company’s Audit and Supervisory Board has resolved to appoint Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC as the Company’s certified public accountant or auditing firm, having concluded that the firm upholds a system for robust auditing and can offer new perspectives on the Company’s audit. 

 The reports of Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the subsequent interim period through March 27, 2020, there was no disagreement with Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to their satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their report, or any “reportable event” as that term is described in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F. 

 The Company has provided a copy of the above statements to Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC and requested that Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not they agree with the above disclosure. A copy of that letter, dated March 27, 2020, is filed as exhibit 15 to this annual report on Form 20-F. 

 Further, during the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, and the subsequent interim period through March 27, 2020, the Company has not consulted with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the consolidated financial statements of Canon; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement as that term is defined in Item 16F(a)(1)(iv) of Form 20-F
 or a “reportable event” as described in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F.

  Item 16G. Corporate Governance 


 Significant Differences in Corporate Governance Practices between Canon and U.S. Companies Listed on the NYSE 



 Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the “Manual”) provides that companies listed on the NYSE must comply with certain corporate governance standards. However, foreign private issuers whose shares have been listed on the NYSE, such as the Company, are permitted, with certain exceptions, to follow the laws and practices of their home country in place of the corporate governance practices stipulated under the Manual. In such circumstances, the foreign private issuer is required to disclose the significant differences between the corporate governance practices under Section 303A of the Manual and those required in Japan. A summary of these differences as they apply to the Company is provided below. 

 1. Directors 

 Currently, the Company’s board of directors does not have any director who could be regarded as an “independent director” under the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules for U.S. listed companies. Unlike the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules, the Corporation Law of Japan (the “Corporation Law”) does not require Japanese companies with the Audit & Supervisory Board such as the Company, to appoint independent directors as members of the board of directors. The NYSE Corporate Governance Rules require non-management
 directors of U.S. listed companies to meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without the presence of management. Unlike the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules, however, the Corporation Law does not require companies to implement an internal corporate organ or committee comprised solely of independent directors. Thus, the Company does not have such internal corporate organ or committee.
 The Company currently has two outside directors under the Corporation Law. Under the Corporation Law, an “outside” director is defined as a person who meets the prescribed conditions, such as, that the person is not currently, and has not been in the ten years prior to his or her assumption of office as outside director, an executive director (which means a director concurrently performing an executive role) (gyomu shikko torishimariyaku

), a corporate executive officer, a manager (shihainin

), or any other type of employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries. Such qualifications for an “outside” director are different from the director independence requirements under the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules.
 In addition, pursuant to the regulations of the Japanese stock exchanges, the Company is required to have one or more “independent director(s)/audit & supervisory board member(s),” defined under the relevant regulations of the Japanese stock exchanges as “outside directors” or “outside audit & supervisory board members” (as defined under the Corporation Law), who are unlikely to have any conflicts of interests with the Company’s general shareholders. Each of the outside directors of the Company satisfies the “independent director/audit & supervisory board member” requirements under the regulations of the Japanese stock exchanges. The definition of “independent director/audit & supervisory board member” is different from that of the definition of independent director under the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules. 

 2. Committees 

 Under the Corporation Law, the Company may choose to:(i) have an audit committee, nomination committee and compensation committee and abolish the post of the Audit & Supervisory Board Members; (ii) have an audit and supervisory committee and abolish the post of the Audit & Supervisory Board Members; or (iii) have the Audit & Supervisory Board. The Company has elected to have the Audit & Supervisory Board, whose duties include monitoring and reviewing the management and reporting the results of these activities to the shareholders or board of directors of the Company. While the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules provide that U.S. listed companies must have an audit committee, nominating committee and compensation committee, each composed entirely of independent directors, the Corporation Law does not require companies to have specified committees, including those that are responsible for director nomination, corporate governance and executive compensation.

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
  The Company’s board of directors nominates candidates for directorships and submits a proposal at the general meeting of shareholders for shareholder approval. Pursuant to the Corporation Law, the shareholders then vote to elect directors at the meeting. The Corporation Law requires that the total amount or calculation method of compensation for directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members be determined by a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders respectively, unless the amount or calculation method is provided under the Articles of Incorporation. As the Articles of Incorporation of the Company do not provide an amount or calculation method, the amount of compensation for the directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board Members of the Company is determined by a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders. The allotment of compensation for each director from the total amount of compensation is determined by the Company’s board of directors, and the allotment of compensation to each Audit & Supervisory Board Member is determined by consultation among the Company’s Audit & Supervisory Board Members. 

 3. Audit Committee 

 The Company avails itself of paragraph (c)(3) of Rule 10A-3
 of the Security Exchange Act, which provides that a foreign private issuer which has established the Audit & Supervisory Board shall be exempt from the audit committee requirements, subject to certain requirements which continue to be applicable under Rule 10A-3. 
 Pursuant to the requirements of the Corporation Law, the shareholders elect the Audit & Supervisory Board Members by resolution of a general meeting of shareholders. The Company currently has five Audit & Supervisory Board Members, although the minimum number of Audit & Supervisory Board Members required pursuant to the Corporation Law is three. Unlike the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules, Japanese laws and regulations, including the Corporation Law, do not require the Audit & Supervisory Board Members to be experts in accounting or to have any other area of expertise. Under the Corporation Law, the Audit & Supervisory Board may determine the auditing policies and methods for investigating the business and assets of a Company, and may resolve other matters concerning the execution of the Audit & Supervisory Board Member’s duties. The Audit & Supervisory Board prepares auditors’ reports, determines a proposal for the nomination or removal of the accounting auditors to be submitted to the general meeting of shareholders, and may veto a proposal for the nomination of the Audit & Supervisory Board Members, accounting auditors and the determination of the amount of compensation for the accounting auditors put forward by the board of directors. Under the Corporation Law, the half or more of a company’s Audit & Supervisory Board Members must be “outside” Audit & Supervisory Board Members. An “outside” Audit & Supervisory Board Member is defined as a person who meets the prescribed conditions, such as, that the person has not been in the ten years prior to his or her assumption of office as outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member, a director, an accounting adviser (kaikei sanyo

), a corporate executive officer, a manager (shihainin

), or any other type of employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries. The Company’s current Audit & Supervisory Board Member system meets these requirements. In addition, pursuant to the regulations of the Japanese stock exchanges, the Company is required to have one or more “independent director(s) or independent Audit & Supervisory Board Member(s)” which terms are defined under the relevant regulations of the Japanese stock exchanges as “outside directors” or “outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members” (each of which terms is defined under the Corporation Law) who are unlikely to have any conflict of interests with shareholders of the Company. Among the five members on the Company’s board of auditors, three are outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. In addition, the three outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members are also qualified as independent Audit & Supervisory Board Members under the regulations of the Japanese stock exchanges; however, one of such Audit & Supervisory Board Members does not satisfy the Company’s independence standards for Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The qualifications for an “outside” or “independent” Audit & Supervisory Board Member under the Corporation Law or the regulations of the Japanese stock exchanges are different from the audit committee independence requirement under the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules.

  4. Shareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plans 

 The NYSE Corporate Governance Rules require that shareholders be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and any material revisions of such plans, with certain limited exceptions. Under the Corporation Law, a Company is required to obtain shareholder approval regarding the stock options to be issued to directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members as part of remuneration of directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Member.

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of

 

 Canon Inc.

 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements

 

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Canon Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 18 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

 Basis for Opinion

 

 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Critical Audit Matters

 

 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

|  |  | Valuation of goodwill |
| Description of the Matter |  | As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. At December 31, 2019, goodwill related to the Commercial printing business and the Medical system business unit was ¥27,205 million and ¥508,907 million, respectively. The calculated fair value of these reporting units was in excess of the carrying value by narrower margins than impairment tests performed for the other reporting units. |

 [Table of Contents](#toc)
 


|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | Significant estimation is required in determining the fair value of the reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating profit ratio and weighted average costs of capital which are affected by expectations about future markets or economic conditions. Auditing such annual goodwill impairment tests was complex and judgmental. |
|  |  |  |
| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit |  | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risk of material misstatement relating to management’s annual assessment of goodwill impairment, including internal controls over the significant assumptions.       To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among other things, evaluating the valuation methodology used for fair value estimation and testing the weighted average cost of capital with assistance of our network firm specialist. We evaluated the significant assumptions used by management by comparing those assumptions to historical results, current economic trends, and other relevant factors. We compared the assumptions used in the previous year’s impairment test and the actual results and evaluated the effect on the fair value estimation for the current year. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions by evaluating the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in significant assumptions. In addition, we compared management’s reconciliation of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Valuation of rebate accruals |
| Description of the Matter |  | As described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, sales transaction prices are determined based on contracts with customers that contain certain forms of variable consideration, including volume-based rebates. Variable consideration is estimated based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sales. The Company recorded accruals for variable consideration (“rebate accruals”) within the accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets.       Rebate accruals related to volume-based rebates which will be paid for products that will sell through from retailers or distributors to end users are sensitive to significant assumptions such as the estimated units to be sold during the promotion periods and level of the rebate provided on those units. Auditing such rebate accruals at period end was complex and judgmental. |
|  |  |  |
| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit |  | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risk of material misstatement relating to management’s assessment of the rebate accrual estimation including evaluating the controls related to the significant assumptions described above.       To test the year end rebate accruals, we performed audit procedures that included, among other things, evaluating the data utilized in establishing the rebate accruals including sales volume and levels of rebate provided. We also compared rebate accruals recorded in the prior year to actual rebate claims to evaluate the effect on the estimation for current year rebate accruals. In addition, we tested actual rebate claims and additional rebate accruals established subsequent to the year end and considered whether they corroborate or contradict the year end rebate accruals. |

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

 

 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of

 

 Canon Inc.

 

 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

 We have audited Canon Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Canon Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 18 and our report dated March 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

 Basis for Opinion

 

 The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting


 A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Canon Inc. (the “Company”) and subsidiaries (collectively “Canon”) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers in such fields as office products, imaging system products, medical system products and industry and other products. Office products consist mainly of office multifunction devices (“MFDs”), laser multifunction printers (“MFPs”), laser printers, digital continuous feed presses, digital sheet-fed
 presses, wide-format
 printers and document solutions. Imaging system products consist mainly of interchangeable-lens digital cameras, digital compact cameras, interchangeable lenses, compact photo printers, inkjet printers, large format inkjet printers, commercial photo printers, image scanners and calculators. Medical system products consist mainly of digital radiography systems, diagnostic X-ray
 systems, computed tomography (“CT”) systems, magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) systems, diagnostic ultrasound systems, clinical chemistry analyzers and ophthalmic equipment. Industry and other products consist mainly of semiconductor lithography equipment, FPD (Flat panel display) lithography equipment, vacuum thin-film deposition equipment, organic LED (“OLED”) panel manufacturing equipment, die bonders, network cameras, digital camcorders, digital cinema cameras, multimedia projectors, broadcast equipment, micromotors, handy terminals and document scanners. Sales are made principally under the Canon brand name, almost entirely through sales subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are responsible for marketing and distribution, and primarily sell to retail dealers in their geographic area. Further segment information is described in Note 22. 

 Canon sells laser printers on an OEM basis to HP Inc.; such sales constituted 13.0%, 13.6% and 13.1% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are included in the Office Business Unit. 

 Canon’s manufacturing operations are conducted primarily at 29 plants in Japan and 14 overseas plants which are located in countries or regions such as the United States, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Philippines.

 The Company and its domestic subsidiaries maintain their books of account in conformity with financial accounting standards of Japan. Foreign subsidiaries maintain their books of account in conformity with financial accounting standards of the countries of their domicile. 

 Certain adjustments and reclassifications have been incorporated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). These adjustments were not recorded in the statutory books of account. 

 
 


| (c) | Principles of Consolidation |

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its majority owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities where the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

  




| (d) | Use of Estimates |
| --- | --- |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
 of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the

  reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant estimates and assumptions are reflected in valuation and disclosure of accounts including: revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful receivables, inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, environmental liabilities, deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions and employee retirement 
and severance benefit obligations. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

 
  
 


| (e) | Translation of Foreign Currencies |
| --- | --- |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 Assets and liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside Japan with functional currencies other than Japanese yen are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements are excluded from earnings and are reported in other comprehensive income (loss). 

 Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income (deductions) in the consolidated statements of income. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses were net losses 

of ¥4,236 million, ¥6,044 million and ¥9,775 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respect
ively. 

 
 


| (f) | Cash Equivalents |
| --- | --- |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 All highly liquid investments acquired with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Certain debt securities with original maturities of less than three months, classified as available-for-sale
 securities of ¥506 million and
 ¥70,500 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.
 
 


| (g) | Investments |
| --- | --- |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 Investments consist primarily of time deposits with original maturities of more than three months, debt and equity securities and investments in affiliated companies. 

 Canon classifies investments in debt securities as available-for-sale
 securities. Canon does not hold any trading securities which are bought and held primarily for the purpose of sale in the near term, or any held-to-maturity
 securities. Canon reports investments with maturities of less than one year as short-term investments.
 Available-for-sale
 debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair value that are not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at fair value which is determined based on quoted market prices, projected discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques as appropriate. The changes in fair value are recognized in net income for equity securities and in other comprehensive income for available-for-sale
 debt securities. 

 Available-for-sale
 debt securities are regularly reviewed for other-than-temporary declines in the carrying amount based on criteria that include the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and Canon’s intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. For available-for-sale
 securities for which the declines are deemed to be other-than-temporary and there is no intent to sell, the impairment are separated into the amount related to credit loss, which is recognized in

  earnings and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). For available-for-sale
 securities for which the declines are deemed to be other-than-temporary and there is an intent to sell, the impairments in their entirety are recognized in earnings. Canon recognizes an impairment loss to the extent by which the cost basis of the investment exceeds the fair value of the investment. 

 Canon measures non-marketable
 equity securities without readily determinable fair value at cost, minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observables price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. 

 Realized gains and losses are determined by the average cost method and reflected in earnings. 


 Investments in affiliated companies over which Canon has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not hold a controlling financial interest, are accounted for by the equity method. 


  
 


| (h) | Allowance for Doubtful Receivables |
| --- | --- |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 Allowance for doubtful trade and finance receivables is maintained for all customers based on a combination of factors, including aging analysis, macroeconomic conditions and historical experience. An additional reserve for individual accounts is recorded when Canon becomes aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings. If circumstances related to customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted. When all collection options are exhausted including legal recourse, the accounts or portions thereof 
are deemed to be uncollectable and charged against the allowance. 

 
 


| (i) | Inventories |
| --- | --- |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the average method for domestic inventories and principally by the first-in,
 first-out
 method for overseas inventories.

 Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and acquired intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset and the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.

 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated principally by the declining-balance method, except for certain assets which are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

 The depreciation period ranges from 3 years to 60 years for buildings and 1 year to 20 years for machinery and equipment.

 Assets leased to others under operating leases are stated at cost and depreciated to the estimated residual value of the assets by the straight-line method over the lease term, generally from 
2 years to 
50 
years
.

 
  
 


| (l) | Leases |
| --- | --- |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 As for lessor accounting, Canon provides leasing arrangement to its customers primarily for the sales of office products. Revenue from the sale of these products under sales-type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease. Interest income on sales-type leases and direct-financing leases is recognized over the life of each respective lease using the interest method. Leases not qualifying as sales-type leases or direct-financing leases are accounted for as operating leases and related revenue is recognized ratably over the lease term. When product leases are bundled with maintenance contracts, revenue is allocated based upon the estimated standalone selling prices of the lease and non-lease
 components. Lease components generally include product and financing while non-lease
 components generally consist of maintenance contracts and supplies. Some of the contracts include options to extend or to terminate the lease. Canon takes such options into account to determine the lease term when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise these options. The majority of Canon’s lease contracts do not contain bargain purchase options for their customers.

 As for lessee accounting, Canon has operating and finance leases for various assets including office buildings, warehouses, employees’ accommodations, and vehicles. Canon determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of each contract. Some of the contracts include options to extend or to terminate the lease. Canon takes such options into accounts to determine the lease term when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise these options. Canon’s lease arrangements do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As a rate implicit in the most of Canon’s leases cannot be determined, Canon uses incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement to determine the present values of lease payments. Canon has lease contracts with lease and non-lease
 components, which are accounted for separately. Canon allocates the consideration in the lease contract to the lease and non-lease
 components based upon the estimated standalone prices. Costs associated 
with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

 Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. All goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. If the carrying amount assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, Canon recognizes an impairment charge in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 

 Intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of software, trademarks, patents and developed technology, license fees and customer relationships, which are amortized using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of software are from 3 years to 8 years, trademarks are 15 years, patents and developed technology are from 7 years to 17 years, license fees are 7 years, and customer relationships are from 8 years to 15 years, respectively. Certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal-use
 software are capitalized. These costs consist primarily of payments made to third parties and the salaries of employees working on such software development. Costs incurred in connection with developing internal-use
 software are capitalized at the application development stage. In addition, Canon develops or

 Liabilities for environmental remediation and other environmental costs are accrued when environmental assessments or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future obligations are not discounted to their present values.

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and 
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured 
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Canon records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not realizable. 

 Canon recognizes the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax positions will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Benefits from tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not
 recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income taxes in the consolidated statements of income.

 Canon generates revenue principally through the sale of office, imaging system and medical system products, industrial equipment, supplies and related services under separate contractual arrangements. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised goods or services transfers to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Canon expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring these goods or services.

 All derivatives are recognized at fair value and are included in prepaid expenses 
and other current assets, or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 

 Canon uses and designates certain derivatives as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge). Canon formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Canon also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, Canon discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged item, and reclassified in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged
 item is reported.


   
 
  Canon also uses certain derivative financial instruments which are not designated as hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative financial instruments are immediately recorded in earnings. 

 Canon classifies cash flows from derivatives as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

  requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to the previous guidance. For lessors, the standard modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The FASB also modified the definition of a lease. Additionally, this guidance expands the qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to leases. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Canon applied 

the guidance from the quarter beginning January 1, 2019. Canon applied the package of practical expedients that allows it not to reassess whether any existing contracts at or expired contracts prior to the adoption date are or contain leases, lease classification and whether initial direct costs qualify for capitalization, in addition to the short term lease exception. Canon also adopted the transition method for which no restatement of comparative periods and no reassessment of land easements not previously accounted for as a lease that existed at or expired prior to the adoption date are required. The right of use assets for operating leases recognized at January 1, 2019 
was
 ¥125,649 million. The corresponding lease liabilities were also recognized. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operation. For further information, please refer to Notes 6 and 18
. 


 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12,
 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which amends existing guidance to simplify the application of the hedge accounting in certain situations and enables an entity to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. This guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, and requires an entity to present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported. Canon adopted this guidance from the quarter beginning January 1, 2019 with the modified retrospective method through a cumulative effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period. Gains and losses resulting from derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges associated with forecasted intercompany sales, which were previously
 included in other income (deductions) in the consolidated statements of income, are included in net sales after the adoption of this guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operation and financial condition. 

 Recently issued accounting guidance not yet adopted 



 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires entities to use a current expected credit loss model to measure impairments of certain financial assets. Using this model will result in earlier recognition of losses than under the current incurred loss approach, which requires waiting to recognize a loss until it is probable of being incurred. This guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Canon will 
adopt the guidance from the quarter beginning January 1, 2020. Canon does not expect material impacts from the adoption on its consolidated results of operation and financial condition.

 Gross realized gains related to equity securities were ¥18,514 
million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross realized losses, including write-downs for impairments that were other-than-temporary, 

were ¥42 
million for the years ended December 31, 2017. 


 During the year ended December 31, 2017
, Canon contributed certain marketable equity securities, not including those of its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to an established employee retirement benefit trust, with no cash proceeds there on. The fair value of those securities at the time of contribution was ¥30,473 million. Upon contribution of those available-for-sale
 securities, the unrealized gains amounting to ¥17,836 million were realized and were included in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of income.
 The carrying amount of non-marketable
 equity securities without readily determinable fair value 
totaled ¥8,448 million and ¥4,629 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The impairment or other adjustments resulting from observable price changes recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not significant. 

 The unrealized and realized gains and losses related to debt securities were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 


 Time deposits with original maturities of more than three months are ¥1,767 million and ¥326 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included in short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

 Investments in affiliated companies accounted for by the equity method amounted to ¥19,988 million and ¥21,312 
million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Canon’s share of the net earnings in affiliated companies accounted for by the equity method, included in other income (deductions), were losses 

of ¥311 
million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and earnings of

 ¥1,414 million and ¥1,196 
million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively.

 Finance Receivables and Operating Leases 




 Finance receivables represent financing leases which consist of sales-type leases and direct 
financing leases resulting from the sales of Canon’s and complementary third-party products. These receivables typically have terms ranging from 1 year to 7 years. The components of the finance receivables, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are as follows:

  Canon has policies in place to ensure that its products are sold to customers with an appropriate credit history and continuously monitors its customers’ credit quality based on information including length of period in arrears, macroeconomic conditions, initiation of legal proceedings against customers and bankruptcy filings. The allowance for credit losses of finance receivables is evaluated collectively based on historical experience of credit losses. An additional reserve for individual accounts is recorded when Canon becomes aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings. Finance receivables which are past due or are individually evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are not significant.

 The cost of equipment leased to customers under operating leases included in property, plant and equipment, net at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 


¥116,681 million and ¥120,457 million, respectively. Accumulated depreciation on equipment under operating leases at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was ¥82,633 million and ¥82,698 million, respectively.

 The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have contributory and noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their employees. Benefits payable under the plans are based on employee earnings and years of service. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries also have defined contribution pension plans covering substantially all of their employees. Canon Medical Systems Corporation (“CMSC”) temporarily participated in Toshiba Corporate Pension Funds (“Toshiba Funds”) after CMSC was acquired by Canon in 2016. In April 2018, CMSC established a new pension provision which provides participants an equivalent level of benefits as compared to the Toshiba Funds. As of December 31, 2018, a majority of plan participants had been transferred from the Toshiba Funds into the new pension provision. Canon calculated the projected benefit obligations for the remaining participants within the Toshiba Funds based on the benefit level of the Toshiba Funds and included the proportional share of the plan assets to which CMSC had a legal right in the following tables for the remaining participants as of December 31, 2018. In March 2019, CMSC settled the pension obligations attributed to the remaining participants within the Toshiba Funds. The loss recognized due to the settlement in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was not significant. 


 Obligations and funded status 



 
 Reconciliations of beginning and ending balances of the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of the plan assets are as follows:

 Canon determines the expected long-term rate of return based on the expected long-term return of the various asset categories in which it invests. Canon considers the current expectations for future returns and the actual historical returns of each plan asset category. 

Plan assets 




Canon’s investment policies are designed to ensure adequate plan assets are available to provide future payments of pension benefits to eligible participants. Taking into account the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, Canon formulates a “model” portfolio comprised of the optimal combination of equity securities and debt securities. Plan assets are invested in individual equity and debt securities using the guidelines of the “model” portfolio in order to produce a total return that will match the expected return on a mid-term
 to long-term basis. Canon evaluates the gap between expected return and actual return of invested plan assets on an annual basis to determine if such differences necessitate a revision in the formulation of the “model” portfolio. Canon revises the “model” portfolio when and to the extent considered necessary to achieve the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
Canon’s model portfolio for Japanese plans consists of three major components: approximately 25% is invested in equity securities, approximately 50% is invested in debt securities, and approximately 25% is invested in other investment vehicles, primarily consisting of investments in life insurance company general accounts. 

Outside Japan, investment policies vary by country, but the long-term investment objectives and strategies remain consistent. Canon’s model portfolio for foreign plans has been developed as follows: approximately 35% is invested in equity securities, approximately 20% is invested in debt securities, and approximately 45% is invested in other investment vehicles, primarily consisting of investments in real estate assets. 

The equity securities are selected primarily from stocks that are listed on the securities exchanges. Prior to investing, Canon has investigated the business condition of the investee companies, and appropriately diversified investments by type of industry and other relevant factors. The debt securities are selected primarily from government bonds, public debt instruments, and corporate bonds. Prior to investing, Canon has investigated the

quality of the issue, including rating, interest rate, and repayment dates, and has appropriately diversified the investments. Pooled funds are selected using strategies consistent with the equity and debt securities described above. As for investments in life insurance company general accounts, the contracts with the insurance companies include a guaranteed interest rate and return of capital. With respect to investments in foreign investment vehicles, Canon has investigated the stability of the underlying governments and economies, the market characteristics such as settlement systems and the taxation systems. For each such investment, Canon has selected the appropriate investment country and currency. 


The three levels of 


input used to measure fair value are more fully described in Note 21. The fair values of Canon’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, by asset category, are as follows:

Plan assets (continued)




Level 1 assets are comprised principally of equity securities and government bonds, which are valued using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions. Level 2 assets are comprised principally of pooled funds that invest in equity and debt securities, corporate bonds, investments in life insurance company general accounts and other assets. Pooled funds are valued at their net asset values that are calculated by the sponsor of the fund and have daily liquidity. Corporate bonds are valued using quoted prices for identical assets in markets that are not active. Investments in life insurance company general accounts are valued at conversion value. Other assets are comprised principally of interest bearing cash and hedge funds.
  


The fair values
 of Level 3 asset, consisting of hedge funds, were

 ¥218 million and 

¥1,451 

 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amounts of actual returns on, purchases and sales of these assets during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not significant.

 basis of total plan assets of Toshiba Funds.

 The net changes in the total valuation allowance were a decrease of ¥3,056 million, a decrease of ¥49 million and an increase of ¥4,096 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

 Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the net deductible temporary differences are expected to reverse, management believes it is more likely than not that Canon will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, at December 31, 2019.

  At December 31, 2019, Canon had net operating losses which can be carried forward for income tax purposes of ¥130,907 million to reduce future taxable income. Periods available to reduce future taxable income vary in each tax jurisdiction and generally range from one year to an indefinite period as follows: 

 
 


|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | (Millions of yen) | |  |
| Within one year |  |  | 1,980 |  |
| After one year through five years |  |  | 28,550 |  |
| After five years through ten years |  |  | 31,871 |  |
| After ten years through twenty years |  |  | 17,137 |  |
| Indefinite period |  |  | 51,369 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  | 130,907 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
 Income taxes have not been accrued on undistributed earnings of domestic subsidiaries as the tax law provides a means by which the dividends from a domestic subsidiary can be received tax free. 

  
 Canon has not recognized deferred tax liabilities of ¥24,886 million for a portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of ¥994,886 million as of 
December 31, 2019 because Canon intends to permanently reinvest such undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Deferred tax liabilities will be recognized when such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested. 


 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

| Additions for tax positions of prior years |  |  | 204 |  |  |  | 178 |  |  |  | 250 |  |
| Reductions for tax positions of prior years |  |  | (44 | ) |  |  | (17 | ) |  |  | (915 | ) |
| Settlements with tax authorities |  |  | (402 | ) |  |  | (1,286 | ) |  |  | — |  |
| Other |  |  | (287 | ) |  |  | (553 | ) |  |  | 673 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Balance at end of year \* |  |  | 8,120 |  |  |  | 8,649 |  |  |  | 10,282 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 



| \* | The unrecognized tax benefits were offset by deferred tax assets in the amount of  ¥933 million, ¥2,043 million and ¥124 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017,  respectively, and reported under “other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets. |
| --- | --- |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 The total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce the effective tax rate, if recognized, were ¥8,120 million and ¥8,649 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

 Although Canon believes its estimates and assumptions of unrecognized tax benefits are reasonable, uncertainty regarding the final determination of tax examination settlements and any related litigation could affect the effective tax rate in a future period. Based on each of the items of which Canon is aware at December 31, 2019, no significant changes to the unrecognized tax benefits are expected within the next twelve months.

 Canon recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes. Both interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and interest and penalties included in income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not significant.

  Canon files income tax returns in Japan and various foreign tax jurisdictions. In Japan, Canon is no longer subject to regular income tax examinations by the tax authority for years before 2017 with few exceptions. Canon is also no longer subject to a transfer pricing examination by the tax authority for years before 2017 with few exceptions. In other major foreign tax jurisdictions, including the United States and the Netherlands, Canon is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities 
for years before 2009 with few exceptions. 


  
 


| 12. | Legal Reserve and Retained Earnings |
| --- | --- |

  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 The Corporation Law of Japan provides that an amount equal to 10% of distributions from retained earnings paid by the Company and its Japanese subsidiaries be appropriated as a legal reserve. No further appropriations are required when the total amount of the additional paid-in
 capital and the legal reserve equals 25% of their respective stated capital. The Corporation Law of Japan also provides that additional paid-in
 capital and legal reserve are available for appropriations by resolution of the shareholders. Certain foreign subsidiaries are also required to appropriate their earnings to legal reserves under the laws of their respective countries.

 Cash dividends and appropriations to the legal reserve charged to retained earnings for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 represent dividends paid out during those years and the related appropriations to the legal reserve. Retained earnings at December 31, 2019 did not reflect current year-end 
 dividends in the amount of ¥85,107 million which were approved by the shareholders in March 2020.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  The amount available for dividends under the Corporation Law of Japan is based on the amount recorded in the Company’s nonconsolidated books of account in accordance with financial accounting standards of Japan. Such amount was ¥853,374 million at December 31, 2019. 

 Retained earnings at December 31, 2019 included Canon’s equity in undistributed earnings of affiliated companies accounted for by the equity method in the amount of ¥17,657 million.

| 14 . | Revenue |
| --- | --- |













Revenue from sales of office products, such as office MFDs and laser printers, and imaging system products, such as digital cameras and inkjet printers, is recognized upon shipment or delivery, depending upon when the customer obtains controls of these products. 


Revenue from sales of equipment that are sold with customer acceptance provisions related to their functionality including optical equipment such as semiconductor lithography equipment and FPD lithography equipment, and certain medical equipment such as CT systems and MRI systems, is recognized when the equipment is installed at the customer site and the agreed-upon specifications are objectively satisfied. 


Most of Canon’s service revenue is generated from office and medical system products which is recognized over time. For the service contracts of office products, the customer typically pays a variable amount based on usage, a stated fixed fee or a stated base fee plus a variable amount which frequently include the provision of consumables as well as break fix activities. The majority portion of service revenue from the office products is recognized as billed since the invoiced amount directly correlates with the value to the customer of the underlying performance obligation to date. For the service contracts of medical system products, the customer typically pays a stated fixed fee for the stand ready maintenance service and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.

| --- | --- |













The majority of service arrangements for office products are executed in combination with related products. Transaction prices for products and services need to be allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis where judgements are required. Canon estimates the standalone selling price using a range of prices that would meet the allocation objective based on all the information that is reasonably available including market conditions and other observable inputs. If transaction prices of the product or service contracts are not within the acceptable range then the revenue is subject to allocation based on the estimated standalone selling prices. Canon recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when related office products are sold. 


The transaction prices that Canon is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer include certain forms of variable consideration, including product discounts, customer promotions and volume-based rebates mainly for imaging system products, which are sold predominantly through distributors and retailers. Canon includes estimated amounts in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Variable considerations are estimated based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale, and are subsequently adjusted in each period based on current information. In addition, Canon may provide a right of return on our products for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the transaction price, and accordingly Canon recognizes revenue based on the estimated amount to which Canon expects to be entitled after considering expected returns. 


Disaggregated revenue by timing is as follows. Disaggregated revenue by business unit, product and geographic area are described in Note 22.

| --- | --- |

  Canon recognizes contract assets primarily for unbilled receivables mainly arising from services contracts for office products. Contract assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were ¥43,783 million and ¥50,799 million, respectively, and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 


 Canon typically bills to the customer when the 
performance obligation is satisfied and collects the payment in relatively short term except for certain maintenance service of office and medical products and certain industrial equipment for which Canon occasionally receives the payment in advance from customers. The amount received in excess of revenue recognized is recognized as deferred revenue until the performance obligation for distinct goods or services are satisfied. Deferred revenue at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were ¥113,030
 million and ¥123,686
 million, respectively, and are included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019, which had been included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2018, was ¥88,306
 million. 

 Remaining performance obligations for products and equipment at December 31, 2019 primarily arise from the sales of certain industrial equipment, amounting to ¥114,617
 million,

 73% of which is expected to be recognized as revenue within one year and remaining 27% is within two
 years. Disclosure of remaining performance obligations is not required for the majority of services

 since the related 
revenue is recognized on an 
as billed basis applying the right to invoice practical expedient or is generated from the contracts with original expected duration of less than one year. The portion of fixed maintenance service contract for office and medical products with original expected duration of more than one year is approximately 12% of total service revenue and the average remaining period for these fixed contracts as of December 31, 2019 is about 2 years. 

 Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of income.

 Risk management policy 



 Canon operates internationally, exposing it to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Derivative financial instruments are comprised principally of foreign exchange contracts utilized by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to reduce the risk. Canon assesses foreign currency exchange rate risk by continually monitoring changes in the exposures and by evaluating hedging opportunities. Canon does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Canon is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance
 by counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but it is not expected that any counterparties will fail to meet their obligations. Most of the counterparties are internationally recognized financial institutions and selected by Canon taking into account their financial condition, and contracts are diversified across a number of major financial institutions.
 Foreign currency exchange rate risk management 



 
 Canon’s international operations expose Canon to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Canon uses foreign exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures principally from the exchange of U.S. dollars and euros into Japanese yen. These contracts are primarily used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of forecasted intercompany sales and intercompany trade receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies. In accordance with Canon’s policy, a specific portion of foreign currency exposure resulting from forecasted intercompany sales are hedged using foreign exchange contracts which principally mature within three months.

  Cash flow hedge 



 
 Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges, including foreign exchange contracts associated with forecasted intercompany sales, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These amounts are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged items affect earnings. Substantially all amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2019 are expected to be recognized in net sales over the next twelve months. After the adoption of ASU No. 2017-12
 from the quarter beginning January 1, 2019, Canon includes the time value component in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, which had been previously excluded. Changes in the fair value of a foreign exchange contract for the period between the date that the forecasted intercompany sales occur and its maturity date are recognized in earnings. 

 Derivatives not designated as hedges 



 
 Canon has entered into certain foreign exchange contracts to primarily offset the earnings impact related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with certain assets denominated in foreign currencies. Although these foreign exchange contracts have not been designated as hedges as required in order to apply hedge accounting, the contracts are effective from an economic perspective. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in earnings immediately. 

 Contract amounts of foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are set forth below:

 Commitments 



 
 At December 31, 2019, commitments outstanding for the purchase of property, plant and equipment approximated ¥36,241
 million, and commitments outstanding for the purchase of parts and raw materials approximated ¥112,831
 million. 

 Guarantees 




 Canon occupies sales offices and other facilities under lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases. Deposits mainly for restoration 
made under such arrangements aggregated ¥11,778
 million and ¥12,728
 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included in noncurrent receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 Canon provides guarantees for its employees, affiliates and other companies. The guarantees for the employees are principally made for their housing loans. The guarantees for affiliates and other companies are made for their lease obligations and bank loans to ensure that those companies operate with less financial risk.

 Canon would have to perform under a guarantee if the borrower defaults on a payment within the contract terms. The contract terms are 1
 year to 15
 years in case of employees with housing loans, and 1
 year to 5
 years in case of affiliates and other companies with lease obligations and bank loans. The maximum amount of undiscounted payments Canon would have had to make in the event of default is ¥2,987
 million at December 31, 2019. The carrying amounts of the liabilities recognized for Canon’s obligations as a guarantor under those guarantees at December 31, 2019 were not significant.
  


 
  Canon also offers assurance-type warranties under which it generally guarantees the performance of products delivered and services rendered for a certain period or term. Estimated product warranty costs are recorded at the time revenue is recognized and are included in selling, general and administrative 

 expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Estimates for accrued product warranty costs are based on historical experience. Accrued product warranty costs are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the changes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows:

  Legal proceedings 




 
 Canon is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Canon has recorded provisions for liabilities when it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Canon reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of the negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Based on its experience, although litigation is inherently unpredictable,

 Legal proceedings (continued)




 
 Canon believes that any damage amounts claimed in outstanding matters are not a meaningful indicator of Canon’s potential liability. In the opinion of management, any reasonably possible range of losses from outstanding matters would not have a material adverse effect on Canon’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

 Fair value of financial instruments 



 
 The estimated fair values of Canon’s financial instruments at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are set forth below. The following summary excludes cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, finance receivables, noncurrent receivables, short-term loans, trade payables and accrued expenses, and the fair values of these instruments approximate their carrying amounts. The summary also excludes investments and derivative instruments which are disclosed in Note 2 and Note 21, and Note 17, respectively. 





|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

|  |  | (Millions of yen) | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  |
| Long-term debt, including current installments |  |  | (354,444 | ) |  |  | (354,444 | ) |  |  | (364,602 | ) |  |  | (364,570 | ) |

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
 The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value in the above table. 


 
 
 
  
  Long-term debt 



 Canon’s long-term debt instruments are classified as Level 2 instruments and valued based on the present value of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using current market borrowing rates for similar debt instruments of comparable maturity. The levels are more fully described in Note 21. 


 Limitations of fair value estimates 



 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 


 Concentrations of credit risk 




 
 At December 31, 2019 and 2018, one customer accounted for approximately 10
% and 12
% of consolidated trade receivables, respectively. Although Canon does not expect that the customer will fail to meet its obligations, Canon is potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk if the customer failed to perform according to the terms of the contracts.

  participants at the measurement date. A three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value is as follows:




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Level 1 |  |  | – |  |  | Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Level 2 |  |  | – |  |  | Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Level 3 |  |  | – |  |  | Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable, which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in establishing a price. |

 Canon operates its business in four
 segments: the Office Business Unit, the Imaging System Business Unit, the Medical System Business Unit, and the Industry and Others Business Unit, which are based on the organizational structure and information reviewed by Canon’s management to evaluate results and allocate resources.

  Intersegment sales are recorded at the same prices used in transactions with third parties. Expenses not directly associated with specific segments are allocated based on the most reasonable measures applicable. Corporate expenses include certain corporate research and development expenses. Amortization costs of identified intangible assets resulting from the purchase price allocation of CMSC are also included in corporate expenses. Segment assets are based on those directly associated with each segment. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments, deferred tax assets, goodwill, identified intangible assets from acquisitions and corporate properties. Capital expenditures represent the additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets measured on an accrual basis.
